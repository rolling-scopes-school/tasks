# Technical interview

The goal of the technical interview is to give opportunity to students to be prepared for a real React interview.

## Interview:

1. The interview is **mandatory** and a minimum score of 4 points out of 10 (coefficient of 10) is **required to receive the certificate**
2. Should be conducted after first 6 modules completion (during the final task phase)
3. In order to be allowed to participate in an interview, student should earn at least 200 points during the first 6 modules or should have a recommendation from their mentor

## Interview structure

The technical interview should be comprised of:

1. Introduction
   This part assumes acquaintance. You should introduce yourself, briefly tell about your experience and ask the student to introduce himself and describe his experience (you could also ask about his motivation in chosing the Front-end stack).
   You should also describe the interview structure and ask the student whether he/she has any questions.
   **This part should ease tension and make the interview more productive.**
2. Theory  
   You can and should ask questions and listen to the answers. Please, do not interrupt the student or provide answers instead of him. It's worth taking notes on some specific answers to discuss them later during the feedback. Student should be speaking approximately 80% of this part's time (the rest 20% should be an interviewer speaking).
3. Practical task
   Small task in React. Please, pay attention to the code, knowledge of the basic React patterns and ability to solve the task.
   You can use online editors for mutual work for this task (e.g. [ReplIT](https://replit.com/))
4. Feedback
   You can base it on the notes you were taking during the 2nd phase. The goal is to give an objective assessment. You should point out the strengths first (even if it was little), and then discuss the areas for improvement. Please, share the theoretical materials which can address the issue.
5. Final part
   **Important part**
   You should ask the student whether he/she has any questions. You should also thank the student for his/her time and wish him/her all the best in his/her endeavours.
