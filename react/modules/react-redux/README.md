# [React](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) Redux üåü

## Module Overview üìö

This module introduces students to React Redux with Redux Toolkit. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of integrating Redux state management into React applications. The module covers a range of topics from understanding the principles of Redux and Redux Toolkit to implementing Redux state management using React Redux bindings and Redux Toolkit.

Additionally, this module covers Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), which simplifies data fetching and caching in Redux applications.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand the principles of Redux and Redux Toolkit.
- Learn how to integrate Redux into React applications using React Redux bindings.
- Explore the usage of Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux state management.
- Get familiar with advanced Redux concepts like middlewares (e.g. thunks) using Redux Toolkit.
- Learn about Redux Toolkit Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
