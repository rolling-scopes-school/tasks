# [React](../../) React Hooks and Custom Hooks üé£

## Module Overview üìö

The "React Hooks and Custom Hooks" module delves into the modern approach of building React components using Hooks. It introduces the fundamental hooks provided by React, their practical applications, and the process of creating custom hooks for more complex state management and side effects. This module aims to equip students with the skills to leverage hooks for efficient and readable component design, enhancing their React development proficiency.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand the concept and advantages of React Hooks over class components.
- Learn to use basic React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and others.
- Explore advanced hooks like `useReducer`, `useCallback` and `useMemo` for optimized performance.
- Develop the ability to create custom hooks for reusing stateful logic across multiple components.
- Apply hooks in practical scenarios to manage state, handle side effects, and integrate context.
