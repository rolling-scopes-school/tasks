# [React](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) State Management üåü

## Module Overview üìö

This module introduces students to modern state management solutions in React applications. Students will learn about two popular approaches: Redux Toolkit and Zustand. The module covers core principles of state management and helps students make informed decisions about which solution best fits their needs.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand the principles of state management in React applications
- Learn about different state management approaches and their trade-offs
- Master either Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing application state
- Implement proper state organization and data flow patterns
- Learn to use React Context API for theme management

## Approximate Module Completion Time ‚è±Ô∏è

- **6 hours**
