# Week 6

## React. Redux


!! Task should be implemented in the school’s private repository !!
It should be based on the previous task.

### What should be done:

1. Create a separate branch for this task.
2. Rewrite the state management to Redux using [RTK](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
3. Api requests should be moved to thunks
4. Make a conclusion: what's better - custom state management with Context or Redux?

### Score

The task will be checked by the mentor during the first 6 weeks. Create a Pull Request to the branch of the previous task, for mentor's checking (**DO NOT MERGE**).


1. Api calls from Thunk - **3 points**
2. Redux State Management - **12 points**


If at least one of the requirements is not completed, then the task is evaluated as **0 points**.

### Repository requirements

- the task should be done in the school's **private repository** [How to work with a private repository](https://docs.rs.school/#/private-repository?id=Как-работать-с-приватным-репозиторием) [RU]
- create a branch with the name of the current task in the school's private repository from the branch of the previous task.
- the commit history should display the development process of the application. [Commit-name-requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/git-convention?id=Требования-к-именам-коммитов) [RU]
- after the development is completed, it is necessary to make a Pull Request from the application branch to the branch of the previous task [Requirements for a Pull Request](https://docs.app.rs.school/#/platform/pull-request-review-process). **DO NOT MERGE this Pull Request from the development branch into the previous task branch**
