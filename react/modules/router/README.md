# [React](../../) React Router 🚏

## Module Overview 📚

The "React Router" module explores the powerful routing library for React applications, enabling the development of single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic, client-side routing. Through this module, students will learn to manage and navigate between different components in a React application, simulating multi-page experiences within a single HTML document. The module covers fundamental concepts such as route configuration, navigation, route parameters, and protecting routes.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Grasp the importance of routing in SPAs and how React Router enhances user experiences.
- Understand how to set up and use React Router in a React project.
- Learn to configure routes for displaying different components based on the URL.
- Master navigation between pages using `Link`, `NavLink`, and programmatic navigation with `Navigate`.
- Implement protected routes and authentication flows in a React application.
