The module covers existing test runners used today in React as well as testing libraries.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand how to setup tests in Vite React project.
- Get familiar with testing of the React components.
- Will get theoretical knowledge about testing best practices and will try to apply them on practice.

## Approximate Module Completion Time ‚è±Ô∏è
