# [React](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/react) Performance üåü

## Module Overview üìö

The "React Performance" module delves into techniques and best practices to optimize the performance of React applications. Students will gain insights into various strategies to enhance the speed and efficiency of their React projects. The module covers topics such as code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, and the use of performance monitoring tools to identify and address bottlenecks.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand the importance of performance optimization in React applications.
- Learn how to use React's **memoization** techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Know how to effectively use **React keys** to optimize list rendering.
- Understand the use of **React's useCallback** hook to memoize callback functions.
- Understand how to use **React.memo** to optimize functional components.
- Learn how to use **React's Profiler** to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Learn about **code splitting** and **lazy loading** to improve application load times.
- Understand the impact of **reconciliation** and how to optimize it.
- Learn about **virtualization** techniques to efficiently render large lists.
- Know how to use React Dev Tools track and improve application performance.

## Approximate Module Completion Time ‚è±Ô∏è

- **7 hours**

## React Compiler (beta)

### What is the React Compiler?

The React Compiler is an upcoming feature in React that aims to optimize the performance of React applications by transforming the code at build time. It analyzes the React components and applies various optimizations to improve the runtime performance and reduce the bundle size.

### How is it Connected to React Performance?

The React Compiler enhances performance by:

- **Code Transformation:** It transforms the React code to make it more efficient, reducing the amount of work the browser needs to do at runtime.
- **Static Analysis:** By analyzing the code statically, it can identify and eliminate unnecessary re-renders and optimize the rendering process.
- **Optimized Output:** The compiler generates optimized JavaScript code that runs faster and consumes less memory.

### Necessity of Understanding React Performance

Understanding how React achieves performance is crucial because:

- **Efficient Development:** Knowledge of performance optimization techniques allows developers to write more efficient and scalable React applications.
- **Debugging:** It helps in identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks in the application.
- **Leveraging New Features:** Being aware of the upcoming features like the React Compiler enables developers to take full advantage of the latest optimizations and improvements in React.
