# React: Routing and Hooks

## üß† Task Description

In this task, you will refactor your class components to functional components with hooks and implement routing functionality. You'll add pagination, detailed views, and URL-based navigation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICE

Focus on routing and functional components. Remove any button or functionality which throws exceptions unnecessarily.

## üéØ Task Goals

- Convert class components to functional components using React hooks
- Implement React Router for navigation and URL management
- Create custom hooks for shared logic
- Add pagination with URL synchronization

## Application Requirements

1. **Pagination**:

   - Add pagination for your item list (search results)
   - Display current page in URL using query parameters (e.g., `?page=2`)
   - Pagination should appear after receiving the list of items

2. **Master-Detail View**:

   - Main page displays search results
   - On item click, split page into 2 sections:
     - **Left**: Continue displaying search results
     - **Right**: Display item details using React Router <Outlet>
   - Show loading indicator while fetching details
   - Add close control for details section
   - The details part should be optional ‚Äî by default, no item is selected when the page first loads
   - Reflect page number and selected item in the URL (e.g., `/?page=2&details=1` or `/:page/:detailsId?`). Urls like `/1` or `/1/567` are valid.

3. **About Page**:
   - Create an About page with application author information
   - Include a link to the RS School React course
   - Add navigation to reach the About page from the main application

## Technical Requirements

1. **Branch Management**: Create branch from **"unit-testing"**. Branch name: **"hooks-and-routing"**

2. **Component Conversion**:

   - Convert ALL class components to **functional components** with hooks
   - **Exception**: Keep **Error Boundary** as class component
   - Create custom hook for localStorage operations

3. **Routing Setup**:
   - Add **React Router** in SPA mode using either "Data" or "Declarative" approach ([pick one](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#api--mode-availability-table))
   - Add **404 page** for non-existing routes

## Points

A student can achieve a maximum of 100 points.

## üìö FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### ‚ùì Should the `page` parameter always be in the URL?

Yes. Even if no search term or details are selected, the current page should always be reflected in the URL, e.g., `?page=1`.

### ‚ùì Does "Pagination is present in both URL and on the page" mean synchronization?

Yes. The page number in the URL must match the visible pagination state. If the user clicks to go to page 3, the URL should change to `?page=3`.

### ‚ùì Should we use `<Outlet>` for the details section?

Yes. As described in the Master-Detail requirement, the details section should be implemented using React Router‚Äôs `<Outlet>`.

### ‚ùì What if the About page exists but is not linked anywhere?

It is considered partially implemented. For full points, the About page must exist **and** be accessible via a navigation link from the main app.

### ‚ùì My 404 page works on the deployed site, but not on localhost. Is that okay?

No. The 404 page must work **locally**, since cross-checking is done using `localhost`. GitHub Pages or other hosts may override your 404 behavior.

### ‚ùì Do I need to pass the search query in the URL?

Only if you want to. It's not required in the task, but you're free to include it as a `search` query param (e.g., `?page=1&search=pikachu`). It's not part of the scoring though.

### ‚ùì Can I use `useSearchParams` or `useParams`?

Yes. You can choose either or both depending on your routing strategy.

### ‚ùì What should I put in the `details` param?

You should pass the ID (or identifier) of the selected item from the search results, e.g., `?page=1&details=25`.

### ‚ùì My PR is merged into `main`. Is it a penalty?

No. As long as the original PR exists and your code is reviewable, there is no automatic penalty for merging.  
However, merging into `main` is **not recommended**, as it may complicate the review process for your mentor.

### Cross-check (score can be less if some parts of the functionality don't work)

- Custom hook to restore search query from LS - **20**
- Pagination is present in both URL and on the page - **20**
- Upon clicking, open details panel on the right side of the page: - **5**
  - Use router outlet, left side of the page should continue displaying the list of results - **10**
  - Initiate an additional API call, display a loader, and update the URL - **10**
  - Details panel should be closed either on the "close" button click or on the main panel click - **10**
- About page is implemented with author information and a link to the RS School React course - **5**
- 404 is implemented - **5**
- New tests are added for the new functionality - **15**
