# React forms.

## Application Requirements

1. Routing. There will be 3 routes:
   - Main, should have links to other 2 routes
   - Route for the form created using uncontrolled components approach
   - Route for the similar form, but created using **React Hook Form**
2. Redux. Use redux to store the data provided by both approaches on the Main route. You can use tiles to display data taken from each form.
3. Forms
   Both forms will collect the same data:
   - name (validate for first uppercased letter)
   - age (should be number, no negative values)
   - email (validate for email)
   - 2 passwords (should match, display the password strength: 1 number, 1 uppercased letter, 1 lowercased letter, 1 special character)
   - gender (you can use radio buttons or select control)
   - accept Terms and Conditions agreement (T&C, can be a checkbox)
   - input control to upload picture (validate size and extension, allow png jpeg, save in redux store as base64)
   - autocomplete control to select country (all countries should be stored in the Redux store)
     Form should contain labels, which should be connected with inputs (look at **htmlFor**)
4. Validation
   Implement validation according to the inputs description from p. 3. Use **Yup** or **Zod** (but pick just one) for validation. Show errors either above each component, or below (but stick with one approach everywhere). Block submitting the form before all the errors are fixed (disable submit button). Good UX assumes that there are no "jumps" when showing errors.
   - Uncontrolled components should implement validation on submit
   - Approach with **React Hook Form** should implement live validation
5. After submitting the form
   On successful form submission redirect user to the main route with all the previously entered data. Make an indication for a newly entered data on the main route (e.g. show border in a different color for a few seconds, or a different background color)

## Technical Requirements

1. Create a separate branch for this task. Branch name: "forms". For this task you will need to create a new application.
2. Follow the requirements for the project setup listed [here](./project-setup.md)
3. Add **React Hook Form**, **Yup** or **Zod**, **Redux Toolkit** and **React Router** to the application.

## Points

### Student can get 100 points:

- 3 routes (main and 2 routes for forms), Redux is set up and used to collect data from both forms, redirect to main route after submitting the form - **15 points**
- Validation works for both forms according to the requirements (error messages, blocking submit button), **Yup** or **Zod** is used for validation (10 points if works only for one form) - **20 points**
- Name, age, email, gender picker, accept T&C are implemented for both forms and collect data (if something doesn't work, score can be less) - **20 points**
- Input for image is implemented for both forms, image is saved as base64 and dispaly on the main route after redirect - **15 points**
- Passwords (with password strength) are implemented for both forms - **15 points**
- Autocomplete works for both forms - **15 points**
  **Max points should be assigned in case if the requirement has been implemented for both forms, if something doesn't work, score should be less**

### Penalties

- Usage of component libraries, e.g. Material UI, Ant Design: **-100 points**
- TypeScript isn't used: **-95 points**
- Usage of _any_: **-20 points per each**
- Usage of _ts-ignore_: **-20 points per each**
- Presence of _code-smells_ (God-object, chunks of duplicate code), commented code sections: **-10 points per each**
- Validation is implemented without **Yup** or **Zod** - **-25 points**
- Commits after the deadline: **-40 points**
- Pull Request doesn't follow guideline (including checkboxes in Score) [PR example](https://rs.school/docs/en/pull-request-review-process#pull-request-description-must-contain-the-following): **-10 points**
