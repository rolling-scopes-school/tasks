# CoreJS Interview
- CoreJS Interview is in two parts - [basic](#corejs-interview-1-basic-question-examples) and [advanced](#corejs-interview-2-advanced-question-examples).
- Passing all of parts Corejs Interview is mandatory for obtaining the RS School certificate.
- The students are not allowed to be interviewed by their current mentors.
- The students without a mentor can also register for an interview.
- Students should contact the interviewer themselves. Contact details will be available on the RS APP. **Note:** Students should consider that the mentor can be busy (vacation, business trip, workload, etc.), so please get in touch with him as soon as possible.
- At the mentor's request, the interview can take place online or face-to-face.
- Preferable duration of each interview is 45-90 minutes.
- During the interview mentor:
  - asks questions;
  - gets answers;
  - adds/corrects/explains/gives the right answer, if necessary.
- After the interview mentor have to fill in the feedback form (RS APP > Interviews)
