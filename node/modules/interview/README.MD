# Node.js Interview Topics Overview

Preparing for a Node.js interview, especially with a focus on NestJS, requires a deep understanding of both Node.js fundamentals and specific NestJS concepts. This comprehensive guide outlines key topics and advanced features that are often addressed in interviews.

## 🚀 Node.js Fundamental Concepts

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The importance of events for non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Understanding non-blocking I/O mechanisms to enhance application performance.
- **Single-Threaded Model with Event Loop**: How Node.js handles concurrency with a single-threaded model and event loop.

## 🛠️ Core Node.js Modules

- **HTTP**: Creating servers, handling requests and responses.
- **File System (fs)**: File operations such as reading, writing, and deleting.
- **Events**: Handling events with the EventEmitter class.
- **Stream**: Efficient data handling through streaming.

## 🌐 Networking & APIs in Node.js

- **RESTful API Development**: Building RESTful services with Node.js.
- **WebSocket**: Implementing real-time communication between client and server.

## 🐣 Introduction to NestJS

- **Overview of NestJS**: Understanding NestJS as a framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- **Core Principles**: Discussing the modular structure, Dependency Injection (DI), and the use of decorators.

## 🛡️ NestJS and Security

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing security measures in NestJS using Passport, JWT, etc.
- **Guardians and Interceptors**: Utilizing guards for authorization checks and interceptors for transforming responses or binding extra logic before/after method execution.

## 🌿 NestJS Modules and Middleware

- **Modules**: Understanding how modules organize the application structure by encapsulating providers, controllers, and services.
- **Middleware**: Implementing functions that can execute before your route handlers.

## 💾 NestJS and Databases

- **Database Integration**: Connecting your NestJS application with SQL or NoSQL databases.
- **TypeORM and Mongoose with NestJS**: Using ORM and ODM within NestJS for database interactions.

## 📡 Building REST and GraphQL APIs

- **REST API with NestJS**: Best practices for designing RESTful endpoints.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Setting up a GraphQL API using the @nestjs/graphql module.

## 🚢 Microservices with NestJS

- **Microservices Architecture**: Building microservice applications using NestJS.
- **Transport Layer**: Configuring different transport layers (TCP, MQTT, NATS, etc.) for microservice communication.

## 🛂 Exception Filters and Pipes

- **Exception Filters**: Handling and customizing exceptions.
- **Validation and Transformation Pipes**: Validating input data and transforming outputs in NestJS applications.

## 🧪 Testing in NestJS

- **Unit and E2E Testing**: Strategies and tools for testing NestJS applications, including Jest and Supertest.

## 🚀 Performance Optimization in Node.js and NestJS

- **Performance Considerations**: Techniques for profiling and improving Node.js and NestJS application performance.
- **Caching and Clustering**: Implementing caching strategies and leveraging Node.js clusters to optimize NestJS applications.

## 🏗️ Best Practices and Real-world Scenarios

- **NestJS Project Structure**: Organizing code for maintainability and scalability.
- **Real-world Use Cases**: Discussing practical applications and solutions built with NestJS.

By covering these topics, candidates will demonstrate their comprehensive knowledge of both Node.js and NestJS, showcasing their abilities to build scalable, secure, and efficient web applications. Be prepared to discuss your experience with these technologies, share code samples, and explain your decision-making processes in real-world projects.
