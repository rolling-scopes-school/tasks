# [Angular schedule.](../../README.md) Http

## In this module, you will learn:

- How to use the HttpClient service in Angular
- Legacy approach: providing HttpClient via HttpClientModule (deprecated)
- What the `HttpEvent` object is and how to work with HTTP events
- How to intercept HTTP requests using an `HTTP Interceptor`

> ⚠️ Note: Starting from Angular 16, the preferred way to provide the HttpClient service is via the provideHttpClient() function.
> The older HttpClientModule can still be mentioned for compatibility and legacy code understanding.
