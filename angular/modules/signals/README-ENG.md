# Signals

## [RS School. Angular Course.](../../README-RU.md)

## In this module, you will learn:

- What `Signals` are and how they work in Angular
- The benefits of using signals in reactive applications
- How to use `Signals` for state and change management in Angular components and templates

## Approximate time to complete the module

Theory - 5 hours

## Theory

- [Angular Signals: reactive context and dynamic dependency tracking](https://medium.com/@eugeniyoz/angular-signals-reactive-context-and-dynamic-dependency-tracking-d2d6100568b0)

- Benefits of using signals
  - `Asynchronicity` – Signals simplify handling of asynchronous operations like user interactions or server requests
  - `Data flow management` – They help organize and track how data moves through the application
  - `Change tracking` – Signals enable efficient reactivity by automatically reacting to state changes
  - `Multiple subscriptions` – A signal can be observed by multiple subscribers without manual subscription logic
  - `Data manipulation` – Signals allow combining, transforming, filtering, or deriving data easily

## Practical assignment
