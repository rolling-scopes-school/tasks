# Technical Interview

The purpose of the technical interview is to give students the opportunity to prepare for a real Angular interview.

## Interview:

1. Not mandatory and not required to obtain a certificate
2. Must be carried out after completion of all modules (at the final stage of the final assignment).
3. To be eligible to participate in the interview, the student must complete and receive credit for all homework assignments, receive test scores, and be in the final stages of completing the final assignment, or actively participate in its development in the case of a team assignment.

## Interview structure

The technical interview should consist of:

1. Introduction
   This part involves getting to know each other. You should introduce yourself, briefly describe your experience, and ask the student to introduce himself and describe his experience (you can also ask about his motivation in choosing a Front-end stack).
   You should also describe the structure of the interview and ask the student if they have any questions.
   **This part should ease the tension and make the interview more productive.**
2. Theory
   You can and should ask questions and listen to the answers. Please do not interrupt the student or give answers instead. It's worth taking notes to discuss some specific responses later during feedback. The student should speak approximately 80% of the time for this part (the remaining 20% should be the interviewer's).
3. Practical task
   Consider the possibility of using a small practical test task to check the practical skills of the candidate. For example:

- Create a component for displaying a task list represented as an array.
- Create a pipe for filtering tasks - display only completed or uncompleted tasks.
- Create a directive that will color uncompleted tasks in green and completed tasks in red.
  To collaborate on this task, you can use online editors (for example, [ReplIT](https://replit.com/))

4. Feedback
   You can base this on the notes you took in step two. The goal is to provide an objective assessment. First, you should identify the good aspects (even if there were few of them), and then move on to the problems. Please share theoretical materials that can solve this problem.
5. Final part
   **An important part**
   You should ask the student if he/she has any questions. You should also thank the student for their time and wish him/her all the best in his/her endeavors.
