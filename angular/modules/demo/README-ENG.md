# Midterm demo

Task: one team representative need to give a short demo. The goal of the meeting is to show the current progress: what has already been done, how the application works at this stage, what challenges have arisen, and what tasks remain ahead.

## Demo Structure (5–10 minutes)

### Introduction

- Introduce the team.
- Briefly explain what the project is and why it is needed.
- Show a simplified project architecture (e.g., we have an API from service X. We are building the frontend. The design was also created by us. We will demonstrate everything further).

### Demonstration

- Show the idea and main features in a live application or on several slides.
- Present everything that is ready at the moment: frontend, backend, designs, completed tasks.

### Conclusion

- One slide/list with the main difficulties that took the most time.
- Show the plan for further work and the tasks to be completed by the deadline.

## Differences from the Final Presentation

Show what has been done so far. It doesn’t need to work perfectly or look polished. The goal is to report on completed tasks and describe the next steps.

No need to go deep into details (NgRx, tests, libraries, technical decisions — they can be mentioned, but not explained in detail).

Do not show the team’s workflow/process.

There will be no Q&A session.

## Timing

Total duration: 5–10 minutes.

Main focus — demonstrate what has been done so far.
