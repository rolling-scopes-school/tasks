## Introduction to Mentoring

[The Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/) is constantly seeking mentors from any part of the world who are willing to share their knowledge and experience with aspiring Angular developers.

If you have ever studied at RS School, or simply share our "Teach it forward" idea, then you are the ideal candidate!

#### General information:

- The duration of mentoring is 8 - 10 weeks. In case of vacation, business trip, etc., it will be possible to postpone the checking of assignments or transfer students to another mentor.
- Mentoring topics: Angular
- Format: online
- Bonuses:
  - New knowledge and experience (Teaching someone else is the best way to learn @ The Protégé Effect).
  - New acquaintances, new opportunities for communication, plus karma :)
  - Feedback on LinkedIn

#### Mentoring is for you if you:

- Have a desire to share your experience and knowledge
- Want to improve your soft skills
- Are looking for beginning developers for your company or project
- Feel a lack of communication
- Want to teach acquaintances/friends/colleagues but don’t have a ready-made training program
- Or have studied at The Rolling Scopes School and it's time for “Teach It Forward”

#### What is required from you:

- A willingness to help students 😊 If you have worked with Angular in production for more than 6 months, that's wonderful.
- A desire to mentor from 2 to 6 students online or in person
- An ability to dedicate 3 to 5 hours per week

#### Mentor responsibilities:

- Code review of assignments
- Answering students' questions
- Conducting interviews

#### Gentleman's Agreement

Mentors have the primary right to hire the students they teach into their company/project/team.

#### Joint Mentoring

Mentors can team up and mentor students together. In this case, students are still assigned to a specific mentor, but assignments of students in the combined group can be reviewed by mentors as they see fit. For example, they can review assignments and conduct meetings in turns.

## Mentor Registration

### Registration in RS APP

1. To become a mentor, you need to fill out the form - [app.rs.school/registry/mentor](https://app.rs.school/registry/mentor).
2. Some time after registration (from a week to several months), the mentor receives an assignment for the course.
   An email (and/or telegram account) will receive a message asking to confirm registration and an invitation to the organizational webinar.
   During registration confirmation, mentors can specify: - Preferences for student location (your city, country, or random location). - The number of students the mentor wants to mentor. - Acquaintances/friends/colleagues the mentor wants to mentor. If the acquaintance is not on the list, ask them to register for the course - [app.rs.school/registry/student](https://app.rs.school/registry/student).
3. After confirming the registration you will get:

- Access to the mentor chat
- Information about the introductory session for mentors

### Communication Channels

- Telegram channel for mentors. You will get the link to the channel after registration confirmation.
- Weekly meeting for mentors. Held once a week. Duration 30 minutes. Participation is optional. The meeting is recorded, and a summary of the meeting is dropped in telegram.
- [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xwReXYqvs7) - this is the main communication channel for students.
- Closed group of activists and mentors in Discord(https://discord.gg/xwReXYqvs7). Here we discuss the educational process, platform, and everything related to education at RS School. How to access the group is indicated below.
- Getting the mentor role in Discord
  1. Open - https://app.rs.school/profile
  2. Authorize through Discord in the `Discord Integration` block
  3. Add your GitHub name to your Discord nickname. Go to the Discord server (https://discord.gg/xwReXYqvs7), click `Server Settings`, select `Edit Server Profile`, and fill in the `Server Nickname` field as Your Nickname (Your GitHub), e.g., Paval Miatlitski (@pavalEscoba).
  4. Write a message in the Discord channel #👋mentors-reception-desk (https://discord.gg/RNrz6ymyj6). Example message: "Hi everyone, my name is Juan and I'm a mentor from Poland"

### Access to Private Student Repositories

1. All students work with private GitHub repositories of RS School https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school
2. All mentors are added to a separate GitHub Team.
   You can check your invite here - https://github.com/orgs/rolling-scopes-school/invitation
3. Mentors have access to all repositories of students of this course.
4. By default, mentors are subscribed to all changes in student repositories. You can unsubscribe in github settings (Profile>Settings>Notifications>Automatically watch repositories) or using the script - https://github.com/Shastel/runsubscribe

## Getting Mentees

Mentors have the option to select mentees during step "Confirmation of mentorship for the course",
or they can request the course coordinators to assign them the most prepared mentees from the waiting list.

## Mentoring

In the first week of mentoring, the mentor needs to:

- Create a communication channel with their students (in Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- Schedule a weekly meeting with their students
- Familiarize themselves with the rules of interaction between students and mentors
- Read the [algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)

### Basic Rules of Interaction between Students and Mentors

- The communication is initiated by the student. The student should be self-motivated to learn.
- The mentor needs to review the completed works of students within one to two weeks.
- The review of completed works is done through reviewing the respective Pull Requests. [Algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)
- Most questions students ask in the respective Discord channels, not to their mentor. [More about the organization of Discord channels](https://docs.rs.school/#/rs-school-chats).

### Weekly Meeting with Students

- Can be conducted with all students at once or in a 1-on-1 format.
- Can be conducted online (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc.) or offline.
- The standard duration of a meeting is 60 - 90 minutes.
- It's necessary to add the meeting to your calendar and the students' calendars.
- Before the meeting, it's necessary to review open Pull Requests of students. Leave your comments. Each PR should have at least three of your remarks.
- Approximate plan for the meeting:
  - Introduction, discussion of news.
  - Discussion of topics, modules of the curriculum.
  - Discussion of Code review results.
  - Additional topics. For example:
    - Resume/self-presentation preparation and interview passing
    - Scrum, patterns, etc.
  - Answers to students' questions.

### Weekly Activities of the Mentor

- The mentor reviews and evaluates students' works through reviewing the respective Pull Request of students. As a result, each student's PR contains mentor comments on the code, recommendations, and the final score. Each PR should have at least three of your remarks. The score is given by the mentor based on the evaluation criteria specified for each task. After the review, the mentor enters the score into the Score form, based on which the Public Score is generated. [Algorithm for reviewing student PRs](pull-request-review-process.md)
- Conducting a meeting, answering students' questions.
- If the mentor has less than two students or is willing to take more, they can pick students from the Waitlist.

#### Additional mentor activities. Strictly voluntary :)

- Speaking at webinars, conducting YouTube Live broadcasts.
- [Development of educational assignments and tests](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks).
- Development of school applications and utilities. For example, [RS APP](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app).
- Hiring your students into your company.
- Mentoring students on their pet projects.
- Helping students in the school's Discord.
- Developing new courses.
- Your ideas.

## Teach it forward
