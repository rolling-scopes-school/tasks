# Module Topic: Algorithms and Data Structures (Part 1)

## Module Content:

1. Introduction to algorithm complexity characteristics (Big O notation)
2. Introduction to basic data structures
3. Review of typical tasks with arrays and matrices
4. Introduction to Stack and Queue data structures
5. Review of the popular balanced brackets problem solution

## Theory

1. You need to watch video materials about the most popular and frequently used data structures and typical tasks with them (2 hours)
   - [Array](https://youtu.be/Jvm4ShU86yw)
   - [Matrix](https://youtu.be/r8uHNxrfCwc)
   - [Stack](https://youtu.be/TqlSlaMak8Y)
2. Read the [notes](./algorithms.md)
3. [Lecture recording](https://youtu.be/eRYupES3PG0?list=PLzLiprpVuH8df24MzZp-l5QMsJWJbi9qP)

## Practice

You need to solve the proposed tasks.
Attention!

- Students are not expected to solve all algorithmic tasks.
- Copying code from other students (current or previous cohorts) is prohibited.
- Think carefully before submitting someone else's code - is the risk of being expelled worth 3% of points.
