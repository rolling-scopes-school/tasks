# Module Topic: Algorithms and Data Structures (Part 2)

## Module Content:

1. Review of pointer-based data structures
2. Introduction to Linked List data structure
3. Introduction to Tree data structure using Binary Search Tree (BST) as an example

## Theory

1. You need to watch video materials about pointer-based data structures (2 hours)
   - [Linked List](https://youtu.be/NpcHTBOAId0)
   - [Binary Search Tree](https://youtu.be/fnqUD4FTE5Q)
2. [Webinar recording](https://youtu.be/SqQAP4S8PA8?list=PLzLiprpVuH8df24MzZp-l5QMsJWJbi9qP)

## Practice

### Test

You need to pass the test "Test Algorithms & Data structures" in RS APP > Auto Test

### Tasks

You need to solve the proposed tasks.
Attention!

- Students are not expected to solve all algorithmic tasks.
- Copying code from other students (current or previous cohorts) is prohibited.
- Think carefully before submitting someone else's code - is the risk of being expelled worth 3% of points.
