# Task 2: Basic Infrastructure Configuration

![task_2 schema](../../visual_assets/task_2.png)

## Objective

In this task, you will write Terraform code to configure the basic networking infrastructure required for a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

## Steps

1. **Write Terraform Code**

   - Create Terraform code to configure the following:
     - VPC
     - 2 public subnets in different AZs
     - 2 private subnets in different AZs
     - Internet Gateway
     - Routing configuration:
       - Instances in all subnets can reach each other
       - Instances in public subnets can reach addresses outside VPC and vice-versa

2. **Organize Code**

   - Define variables in a separate variables file.
   - Separate resources into different files for better organization.

3. **Verify Configuration**

   - Execute `terraform plan` to ensure the configuration is correct.
   - Provide a resource map screenshot (VPC -> Your VPCs -> your_VPC_name -> Resource map).

4. **Additional TasksðŸ’«**
   - Implement security groups.
   - Create a bastion host for secure access to the private subnets.
   - Organize NAT for private subnets, so instances in the private subnet can connect with the outside world:
     - Simpler way: create a NAT Gateway
     - Cheaper way: configure a NAT instance in the public subnet
   - Document the infrastructure setup and usage in a README file.

## Submission

- Create `task_2` branch from `main` in your repository.
- [Create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) (PR) with the Terraform code in your repository from `task_2` to `main`.
- Provide screenshots of a resource map screenshot (VPC -> Your VPCs -> your_VPC_name -> Resource map) in the PR description.
- (Optional) Set up a GitHub Actions (GHA) pipeline for the Terraform code.

## Evaluation Criteria (100 points for covering all criteria)

1. **Terraform Code Implementation (50 points)**

   - Terraform code is created to configure the following:
     - VPC
     - 2 public subnets in different AZs
     - 2 private subnets in different AZs
     - Internet Gateway
     - Routing configuration:
       - Instances in all subnets can reach each other
       - Instances in public subnets can reach addresses outside the VPC and vice-versa

2. **Code Organization (10 points)**

   - Variables are defined in a separate variables file.
   - Resources are separated into different files for better organization.

3. **Verification (10 points)**

   - Terraform plan is executed successfully.
   - A resource map screenshot is provided (VPC -> Your VPCs -> your_VPC_name -> Resource map).

4. **Additional Tasks (30 points)ðŸ’«**
   - **Security Groups and Network ACLs (5 points)**
     - Implement security groups and network ACLs for the VPC and subnets.
   - **Bastion Host (5 points)**
     - Create a bastion host for secure access to the private subnets.
   - **NAT is implemented for private subnets (10 points)**
     - Orginize NAT for private subnets in a simpler or cheaper way
     - Instances in private subnets should be able to reach addresses outside the VPC
   - **Documentation (5 points)**
     - Document the infrastructure setup and usage in a README file.
   - **Submission (5 points)**
   - A GitHub Actions (GHA) pipeline is set up for the Terraform code.
