# Module Topic: Algorithms and Data Structures (Part 1)

## Module Overview

This module serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures in programming. It aims to provide students with a foundational understanding of algorithm efficiency metrics, such as Big O notation, and the use of various basic data structures. The module covers arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, pointers, linked lists, and binary search trees (BSTs). Through this module, students will not only learn the theoretical aspects but also apply these concepts in solving typical problems.

## Module content:

1. Introduction to algorithm efficiency metric (Big O notation).
2. Introduction to basic data structures.
3. Typical problems with arrays and matrices.
4. Introduction to Stack and Queue data structures.
5. Data structures with pointers.
6. Introduction to Linked Lists.
7. Introduction to Tree data structure based on the example of a BST (Binary Search Tree).

## Theory

1. You need to watch video materials about the most popular and frequently used data structures and typical problems associated with them:

   - [Video lecture: Array (RU)](https://youtu.be/Jvm4ShU86yw) - 15 min
   - [Video lecture: Matrix (RU)](https://youtu.be/r8uHNxrfCwc) - 30 min
   - [Video lecture: Stack (RU)](https://youtu.be/TqlSlaMak8Y) - 20 min
   - [Youtube video: Array](https://youtu.be/txjmvEPlAtU?si=Y2sO3jcBcwR5NjLi) - 10 min
   - [Youtube video: Matrix / part 1](https://youtu.be/CDpJ4PIWAlE?si=jgFFSNyyZOKOiPY8), [Youtube video: Matrix / part 2](https://youtu.be/ajSXu2D2gzg?si=342sreFA-oqZcEQg) - 30 min
   - [Youtube video: Stacks & Queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AJ4ldcH2t4) - 15 min

2. Read:

   - [Notes: Algorithms](./algorithms.md)
   - [Notes: Data Structures](./data-structures.md)

3. You need to watch video materials about data structures with pointers:

   - [Video lecture: Linked List (RU)](https://youtu.be/NpcHTBOAId0) - 25 min
   - [Video lecture: Binary Search Tree (RU)](https://youtu.be/fnqUD4FTE5Q) - 40 min
   - [Youtube video: Linked Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWWEncl76Y) - 15 min
   - [Youtube video: Binary Search Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JeuJRqKJrI) - 20 min

## Practice

You need to solve the proposed algorithmic tasks.
Attention!

- It is not expected for students to solve all of the tasks.
- Copying code from other students (current or previous cohorts) is not allowed.
- Think carefully before submitting someone else's code; is it worth the risk of being expelled for 3% of the total grade?

### Test

You need to complete the "[St1] Test Algorithms & Data structures" in RS APP > Auto Test

Tasks:

- [Tasks: "basic-js-ds"](https://github.com/AlreadyBored/basic-js-ds)
- [Tasks: "basic-js"](https://github.com/AlreadyBored/basic-js)
  - Complete as many tasks as you can.
