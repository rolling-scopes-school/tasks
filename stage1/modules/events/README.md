# [🎯 Stage#1: Events](../../)

## 📚 Module Overview

This module immerses students in the world of browser events and event handling, a cornerstone of interactive web development. They will learn the fundamentals of event-driven programming, understanding how to manage and utilize events within web applications effectively.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

1. Comprehend the concept and significance of an **Event** in web programming.
2. Explore various **Interfaces based on Events**, with detailed references from MDN.
3. Identify starting points and best practices for working with **Events**.
4. Understand and implement **Callbacks** in different scenarios:
   - Grasp asynchronous programming and its applications.
   - Recognize scenarios necessitating callbacks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `addEventListener`, `onClick`).
   - Develop and apply skills in writing code using callbacks.
5. Master **Event Handlers**, learning different techniques to attach and manage them:
   - Utilize `on<event>` attributes and properties within the DOM.
   - Understand reassignment and removal of handlers, along with exceptions.
   - Implement `handleEvent` for object handlers.
6. Delve into the **Event Object**, studying its properties and uses.
7. Understand **Bubbling and Capturing** mechanisms in event propagation.
8. Apply **Event Delegation** for efficient event management.
9. Examine **Browser Default Actions** and strategies to handle them.
10. Learn about **Dispatching Custom Events** for tailored event-driven interactions.
