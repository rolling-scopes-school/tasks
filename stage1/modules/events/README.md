# [🎯 Stage#1: Events](../../)

## 📚 Module Overview

In this module, students will delve into the world of browser events and event handling. They will learn the intricacies of event-driven programming and practice how to manage and utilize events within web applications.

### Students will:

1. Understand the concept of an **Event**.
2. Explore **Interfaces based on Events**, with a complete list referenced from MDN.
3. Discover the starting point for working with **Events**.
4. Grasp the concept of **Callbacks**:
   - Comprehend the definition of asynchronous programming.
   - Learn what it means to be asynchronous.
   - Recognize scenarios that require callbacks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `addEventListener`, `onClick`, etc.).
   - Develop skills in writing code that utilizes callbacks.
5. Master **Event Handlers** and different methods to attach them to events:
   - Utilize the `on<event>` attribute within the DOM tree.
   - Assign properties to DOM objects to handle events.
   - Understand the reassignment of handlers on the target and exceptions.
   - Learn techniques for removing event handlers.
   - Implement object handlers through `handleEvent`.
6. Dive into the **Event Object** and its properties.
7. Study **Bubbling and Capturing** mechanisms.
8. Practice **Event Delegation** to manage events efficiently.
9. Learn about **Browser Default Actions** and how to handle them.
10. Experiment with **Dispatching Custom Events** to tailor event-driven behavior.
