## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can I study the modules and do the projects in advance?

Absolutely!

#### Can I skip webinars?

Yes, you can. Webinar recordings can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/rollingscopesschool).

Videos are more convenient to watch at a speed of 1.25 or higher.

#### Is it mandatory to watch the school's webinars?

No. Links to the recommended theory for study are located in the modules. After studying the module materials independently, you can watch the webinar to reinforce the information or ask questions to the trainer.

#### Can I take the course multiple times?

Yes. 15-25% of students take the course multiple times.

#### I'm attending the school for the first time and can't keep up with all the assignments. What should I do?

Continue learning and don't worry about the rating. 15-25% of students take the course multiple times, and over 30% have been trained in other schools.

#### I'm a beginner. Do I have to complete all the course assignments to the maximum?

This is a common mistake: thinking that you have to go all out, stressing over each task, and eventually giving up after 2-3 months. Do as much as you can manage; don't chase the top spots in the rankings. If you're a beginner juggling work and limited time for learning, it's highly unlikely you'll complete the course in one go—and that's okay. Learning a new profession is not a sprint; it's a marathon. It's better to dedicate two hours a day for a year than to work eight hours a day for two months and then conclude that "it's not for me" because it's hard to compete with those who are retaking the course or have a strong background. A good outcome is not about topping the leaderboards but completing the tasks—even if it's just one out of the ten required. If you've accomplished something you couldn't a month ago, you're heading in the right direction. The course starts once a year, so if you can't complete it this time, you have the opportunity to join again next year, better prepared with the knowledge from earlier stages.
