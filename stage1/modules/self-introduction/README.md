# Self-introduction

The task is to record a short (**3-5 min**) self-presentation video. Share some information about yourself, why you got interested in programming, and the purpose of joining RS School. You can use your completed [Markdown & Git](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/cv/en/git-markdown.md) assignment as a reference.

> ## What to include
>
> - Introduce yourself: say your name, major skill, and role. For example, "My name is ... and I'm a junior Front-end developer."
> - Briefly mention your education. For example, "I am a recent computer science graduate from Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics and currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course."
> - Talk about what you are aspiring to learn, your professional plans and goals, and your motivation to study programming. This information will help mentors select the most motivated students from the Wait list.
> - Also talk about your recent course or pet project. Describe its goal, the main technologies you used, the challenges you faced, and the results you achieved.

However, there are no restrictions to what you need to say about yourself. It is up to you to decide what information to share.

The presentation must be **in English**. Together with the recorded video create a transcript, which is a text of your presentation (it must also be **in English**). Put the link to the video and the transcript into your [private school repository](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository#как-работать-с-приватным-репозиторием) and [deploy it using gh-pages](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository#как-сделать-деплой-задания-из-приватного-репозитория-школы).

## Workflow

1. Record a video of your presentation in English. It is strongly recommended that you show your face in the frame (you can use a webcam, phone camera, video camera, laptop camera, etc. for recording).
2. Upload the video to your personal [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) account. You can make the video accessible only via a link. To do that when uploading, set Visibility > Save or publish > Unlisted. You can change the accessibility settings after uploading as well. To do that go to [Content > Videos > Visibility > Unlisted](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) in the video settings.
3. In your **private school** repository (accessible via a link like `https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/your-github-account-JSFE2023Q4`), create a branch `self-introduction` with the `main` branch as the source one.
4. In the created `self-introduction` branch, create a folder `self-introduction`, and create a file with the name `index.md` inside it.
5. Add a link to your YouTube video to the `index.md` file.
6. Add a transcript of your presentation below the link. The text must be a written copy of what you said in the presentation, although it can be edited to remove unnecessary interjections, filler words, etc., so the transcription does not have to be word-for-word.
7. Use `gh-pages` for deployment. Follow the instructions on [how to deploy an assignment from a private school repository](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository#как-сделать-деплой-задания-из-приватного-репозитория-школы).
8. Create a Pull Request from the `self-introduction` branch to the `main` branch. The Pull Request must have the same name as the assignment – **Self-Introduction**, and it has to meet the [requirements for Pull Requests](https://rs.school/docs/ru/pull-request-review-process#требования-к-pull-request-pr). As a screenshot of the result attach a screenshot of the video and provide a deployment link in the following format `https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/your-github-account-JSFE2023Q4/self-introduction/`. **Do not merge this Pull Request.**

> ### Important
>
> - Ensure that the video and transcript can be accessed through the links you provide and do not require any additional permissions. The easiest way to check this is to try opening both links in Incognito mode in your browser.
> - We do not require you to make the video public. You can make it [accessible only via a link](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). This way only the users who receive the correct URL from you will be able to watch the video.

## Task Check

During [Cross-Check](https://rs.school/docs/ru/cross-check-flow) you will have to check the fact that there is a recording, but **not** its content. The content will later be assessed by mentors.

To submit the completed task for review, go to [RS App](https://app.rs.school/), choose the Cross-Check: Submit tab, select the **Self-Introduction** task in the dropdown menu, and add your **deployment link** to the form.

Also, remember to create a Pull Request from the development branch `self-introduction` to `main` (do not merge this PR) for mentors to be able to watch your presentation.

### Assessment Criteria

The maximum score for the task is **100 points**.

- There is a link to the video with the self-presentation. In the video, the author talks about themselves in English, and the video lasts for about 3-5 minutes (variation within 15 seconds must not be considered either an error or a reason to subtract any points) — **+50 points**.
- There is a transcript of the presentation. The transcript is in English and contains the complete text of the presentation (it is allowed for the script to be slightly edited, though) — **+50 points**.

**Nota bene**: When evaluating, there is **no need to assess the level of English** or the quality of the presentation. Follow only the criteria described above.
