## Notes App

[HOME](../../README.md)

Let's write a simple console application called Notes for working with notes. The application needs to implement 4 methods:

- `create`
- `list`
- `view`
- `remove`

1. The `create` method creates a new note in the notes.json file. The `create` method has two arguments: the note's title and its content.
2. The `list` method displays a list of notes.
3. The `view` method outputs the content of a note whose title is passed as an argument.
4. The `remove` method deletes a note whose title is passed as an argument.

To call these methods, they are specified as command-line arguments.

1. Import the `fs` module for file operations:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
```

2. Assign three arguments to constants â€” the method name, the note title, and the note content:

```js
const [command, title, content] = process.argv.slice(2);
```

3. Create a `switch` statement that calls the corresponding functions for different methods:

```js
switch (command) {
  case "list":
    list();
    break;
  case "view":
    view(title);
    break;
  case "create":
    create(title, content);
    break;
  case "remove":
    remove(title);
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown command");
}
```

4. Write the `create()` function that creates a new note. The function has two parameters: the title of the note `title` and the content of the note `content`:

```js
function create(title, content) {
  const notes = { title, content };
  const json = JSON.stringify(notes);
  fs.writeFile("notes.json", json, (error) => {
    if (error) return console.error(error.message);
    console.log("Note created");
  });
}
```

The function works, but it doesn't add data; instead, it replaces them.

So, we need to:

- Read the existing data from the `notes.json` file using the `fs.readFile()` method
- Convert the received data into an array using the `JSON.parse()` method
- Add new data to the array using the `.push()` method
- Convert the array to JSON using the `JSON.stringify()` method
- Write the data to the `notes.json` file using the `fs.writeFile()` method

```js
function create(title, content) {
  fs.readFile("notes.json", (error, data) => {
    if (error) return console.error(error.message);
    const notes = JSON.parse(data);
    notes.push({ title, content });
    const json = JSON.stringify(notes);

    fs.writeFile("notes.json", json, (error) => {
      if (error) return console.error(error.message);
      console.log("Note created");
    });
  });
}
```

Run the file with the command:

```bash
node index create title content
```

where `title` and `content` are the title and content of the note.

Note that if we were writing data in text format, it would be much easier to append new data using the `fs.appendFile()` method instead of the `fs.writeFile()` method.

Also, it is necessary to write a function `init()` that checks the existence of the `notes.json` file and, if the file does not exist, creates it with the content `[]`. Try to handle this on your own.

5. Write the `list()` function, which reads the `notes.json` document and outputs the titles of the notes:

```js
function list() {
  fs.readFile("notes.json", (error, data) => {
    if (error) return console.error(error.message);
    const notes = JSON.parse(data);
    notes.forEach((note, index) => console.log(`${index + 1} ${note.title}`));
  });
}
```

Since the `notes.json` file is located in the same directory as the code file, there's no need to specify its full path. It's enough to provide its name as the first argument to the `readFile()` method. The second argument of this method is a callback function, which accepts two parameters: an `error` for any encountered errors, and the `data` read from the file.

Converting the received data into an array is done using the `JSON.parse(data)` method. We iterate through this array using the `forEach()` method and, for each element, print its index and the title of the note to the console, creating a numbered list. To start the list from one instead of zero, we add 1 to the index.

6. Implement the `view()` function, which displays the content of a note based on its title.

The function is similar to the `list()` function. It reads the document, converts the received data into an array, and then uses the `find()` method to find the note whose title matches the one specified when calling the function. If there is no such note, it prints a message that the note is not found; otherwise, it prints its content:

```js
function view(title) {
  fs.readFile("notes.json", (error, data) => {
    if (error) return console.error(error.message);
    const notes = JSON.parse(data);
    const note = notes.find((note) => note.title === title);
    if (!note) {
      console.log("Note not found");
      return;
    } else {
      console.log(note.content);
    }
  });
}
```

7. Implement the `remove()` function, which deletes a note by its title.

Just like in the previous functions, we read the file, convert the received data into an array, then use the `filter()` method to filter the data, leaving only those whose titles do not match the passed title. After that, we convert the array to JSON and write it to the file:

```js
function remove(title) {
  fs.readFile("notes.json", (error, data) => {
    if (error) return console.error(error.message);
    let notes = JSON.parse(data);
    notes = notes.filter((note) => note.title !== title);
    const json = JSON.stringify(notes);
    fs.writeFile("notes.json", json, (error) => {
      if (error) return console.error(error.message);
      console.log("Note deleted");
    });
  });
}
```

P.S. The code of this application would look very good as a class with corresponding methods. You can practice and do it yourself.
