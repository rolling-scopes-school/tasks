## Node.js

![Node.js logo](./images/node-logo.jpg)

**Node.js** â€” an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

Node.js is based on the V8 virtual machine. It was created by Google for the Chrome browser. V8 can execute JavaScript faster and more efficiently than any other.

Node.js is used to create web servers, standalone applications, programs for computers and mobile devices, and to program microcontrollers.

Node.js has only one platform, and through continuous improvement, it supports the latest Javascript features. Unlike browser-based JS, you don't need to worry about supporting legacy browsers, and you almost never need to transpile code for older versions of the platform (however, as with browser-based JS, before using the latest language features, it is recommended to check that they are already supported by the selected version of Node.js).

Companies opt for Node.js due to its speedy and straightforward development, the convenience of using a single language for both frontend and backend, the rapid performance of the resulting applications, the capability to craft cross-platform software, and the cost-effective use of resources.

Node.js has its drawbacks, particularly in scenarios demanding intensive calculations, although the introduction of worker threads has notably enhanced its suitability in such cases.
