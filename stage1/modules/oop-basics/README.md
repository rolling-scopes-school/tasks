# [Stage#1](../../../) Object-Oriented Programming Basics 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

The "Object-Oriented Programming Basics" is an introductory module designed to teach students the fundamental concepts and principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This module will cover core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. It is tailored for beginners and aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding and applying OOP.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Grasp the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Understand the concept and importance of classes and objects.
- Learn about inheritance and its role in promoting code reusability.
- Comprehend the significance of encapsulation in data protection.
- Explore polymorphism and its usage in creating flexible code.
- Understand abstraction and its role in simplifying complex systems.
