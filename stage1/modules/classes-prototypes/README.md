# [Stage#2.](../../) Classes & Prototypes 🌟

## Module Overview 📚

This module introduces students to classes and prototypes in JavaScript. It aims to provide an in-depth understanding of classes in JS, objects and inheritance. Through this module, students will explore the concepts of constructor, classical and prototypal inheritance, gaining a solid foundation for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Learning Objectives 🎯
