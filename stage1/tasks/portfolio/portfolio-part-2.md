2. Create a new branch named `portfolio-part2` from `portfolio` branch. You will find the `portfolio` folder containing the project files completed in the previous stage within this branch.
3. Submit the deployment link of your project in the "Cross-Check Submit" section of the [RS APP](https://app.rs.school/).  
  [How to submit](#how-to-submit).
4. Continue working on the task within the branch you have created.
5. Ensure your work meets the [CrossCheck Criteria](#crosscheck-criteria-130-points).
6. Independently evaluate your work according to the provided [Criteria for Evaluation](#criteria-for-evaluation).
7. Create a Pull Request from the `portfolio-part2` branch to the `portfolio` branch, resolve any conflicts that arise, and then merge the Pull Request.  
   The title of the Pull Request can be chosen at your discretion. A description for this Pull Request is not necessary.
8. After completing the cross-check for the previous part of the task, update your project's deployment. For example, you can create and merge a Pull Request from the `portfolio` branch to the `gh-pages` branch.  
   The title of the Pull Request can be chosen at your discretion. A description for this Pull Request is not necessary.
9. Once you have completed your work, update the Pull Request from the `portfolio` branch to the `main` branch to include the newly added functionality from the second part of the task.  
   It is not required to merge this Pull Request.
10. After the task deadline has passed, the cross-check phase will start, lasting three days. Failure to complete and submit cross-check reviews in the "Cross-Check Review" section of the [RS APP](https://app.rs.school/) will result in zero points for this task.

### Penalties

Penalties for the task are assigned by the course curators, not by students. An imposed penalty results in zero points for the task. If you believe there's a reason to apply any of the following penalties in the work you're evaluating, please direct message the link to it to one of the curators:

1. The layout of the entire design or individual blocks is implemented using images, except in cases where the image is specifically required by the design.
2. The use of frameworks, libraries, and technologies that are prohibited in the [Technical Requirements](./portfolio.md#technical-requirements).

## How to Submit

- **Portfolio. Part 2: Adding Functionality** task is evaluated through a cross-check process.
- Upon receipt of the task and prior to the submission deadline, proceed to the RS App at https://app.rs.school/. Navigate to **Cross-Check: Submit**, select the appropriate task from the dropdown list, and enter the URL of your deployed website into the **Solution URL** field. Then click the **Submit** button.

## Submit Recommendations

- Aim to submit early once the submission option becomes available in the RS App. You are free to make additional changes up until the deadline.
- Given that the project is contained within a private repository, there's no need to share repository or pull request links as reviewers will not have access to them. Private repositories are visible only to you, the course administrators, and any assigned mentors.
- Verify that the deployed website link is functional, especially when accessed in the browser's incognito mode.

## Task Evaluation

- Follow the instructions for conducting a cross-check available at: https://rs.school/docs/ru/cross-check-flow
