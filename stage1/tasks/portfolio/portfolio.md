# Portfolio

## Project's Description

Portfolio is the stage#1 task, during which you'll create a responsive landing page and add interactivity.

## Key skills

- Valid semantic responsive web design;
- Easy-to-maintain readable code;
- Exporting styles and graphics from Figma;
- Using JavaScript to implement the functionality specified in the task.

## Project Work Stages

The task consists of three parts:

- [Portfolio. Part 1: Responsive Layout](portfolio-part-1.md)
  - In this part of the task, you need to create a responsive Portfolio page based on the Figma design.
  - The layout will be evaluated for validity, accuracy at specified breakpoints, responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scrollbars..

- [Portfolio. Part 2: Adding Functionality](portfolio-part-2.md)
  - In this part of the task, you need to add interactivity to the page created in the first part;
  - The implemented functionality will be evaluated.

Each part lasts one week and is evaluated through cross-check reviews

## Creating your own copy of the layout

Start the task by creating your own copy of the layout. To do this:

- Log in to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/);
- Open the layout;
- On the left panel, click on the arrow next to the layout name, and select the option "Duplicate to your drafts";
- At the top left, open the settings, and choose "Back to files";
- Open the copy of the layout with the label "Drafts".

## Code quality recommendations

Recommendations are provided for reference; strict adherence to them is not expected and will not be checked.

- [Guideline](https://codeguide.academy/html-css.html#html)
- Code quality guide
  - [General principles](../../modules/clean-code/materials/generic-principles.md)
  - [HTML and CSS recommendations - beginner level](../../modules/clean-code/materials/html-and-css.md)
  - [HTML and CSS recommendations - advanced level](../../modules/clean-code/materials/html-and-css-extended.md)

## Technical requirements

1. The layout is valid, semantic, and matches the design.
2. The application is displayed correctly and functions properly in the latest version of Google Chrome.
3. Using HTML preprocessors and template engines (e.g. `Pug`) **is not allowed**.
4. Using CSS frameworks (e.g., `Bootstrap`) **is not allowed**.
5. Using JS frameworks (e.g., `Angular`, `React`, `Vue`, etc.) **is not allowed**.
6. Using outdated libraries (e.g. `JQuery`, etc.) or pre-built libraries (e.g. `Swiper`, etc) to implement functionality **is not allowed**.
7. Using `TypeScript` **is not allowed**.
8. Using CSS preprocessors (`SASS`, `SCSS`), [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) is allowed.
9. Using a style reset with `reset.css` is not recommended.
10. Adding layout as an image by taking a screenshot of a part of the layout and pasting it into the markup is not allowed. Please use tags and characters for layout, and use images only for adding pictures and icons, not for layout elements (buttons, blocks, sections).
11. The code must be readable, without minification or obfuscation. You are allowed to use bundlers, such as [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), but please enable [source maps](https://web.dev/articles/source-maps). Gulp is unmaintained and must not be used.

## Repository Requirements

- The task must be completed in the school’s private repository. [How to work with a school's private repository](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository)
- Create new branch `portfolio` from `main` branch. Create a folder `portfolio` in the created branch. Place your code in this folder.
- The `main` branch should be empty (contain only files like README.md, .gitignore or .github folder)
- Use `gh-pages` for deployment [How to deploy an assignment from a private school repository](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository#как-сделать-деплой-задания-из-приватного-репозитория-школы)
- Since the task is divided into two parts, portfolio will have two versions:
  1.  The `portfolio` branch will contain the first part of the assignment. When starting the second part, create a branch `portfolio-part2` from the `portfolio` branch to continue from where you left off in the first part
  2.  Upon completing the second part of the assignment, create a Pull Request from the `portfolio-part2` branch to the `portfolio` branch, check for conflicts, and perform the Merge
  3.  Please note: Pull Requests with subsequent merges are only done from the current development branch into the initial branch of this task. Merging into the `main` branch is not performed!
- The internal structure of the project is at your discretion.

## Commit Requirements

- Commit history should reflect the application development process.
- [Give commit names according to the guideline](https://rs.school/docs/ru/git-convention)

## Requirements for Pull Requests

- Name the Pull Request according to the task title
- [Provide the Pull Request description following the template](https://rs.school/docs/ru/pull-request-review-process#требования-к-pull-request-pr)  
  **No need to merge the Pull Request from the development branch into the `main` branch**.

## How to submit

After receiving the task but before the deadline, please go to the RS App at https://app.rs.school/. Select **Cross-Check: Submit**, choose the relevant task from the dropdown menu, and add the link to the deployed version of your created website in the **Solution URL** field. Then, click **Submit** button.

## Submit Recommendations

- It is recommended to submit the task as early as possible, as soon as the option becomes available in the rs app. After submission, you can continue working on the task until the deadline
- Since the project is being done in a private repository, there is no point in submitting a link to the repository or a pull request - the reviewer won't be able to see it. The private school repository is only visible to you, course admins, and your mentors when they become available
- Make sure that the deployed link you provide opens in incognito mode of the browser

## Task Evaluation

- Each part of the assignment is assessed through a cross-check
- Instructions for conducting a cross-check: https://rs.school/docs/ru/cross-check-flow

⚠️ The administration reserves the right to deduct points or apply penalties for violations not explicitly listed in the task description if they affect the validity, fairness, or integrity of the assignment.
