# Hangman

## Task

### Project's Description

[Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) is a classic word game in which you must find the correct answer by guessing letters one at a time.

### Game rules

1. The game is represented by two main parts: **the gallows part** and **the quiz part**.
2. At the beginning of the game, the gallows **is empty**.
3. The quiz part includes:

- a question,
- a secret word (the answer to the question), represented by underscores **for each** letter in the word _(for example, if the secret word is 'address' it will be written like '\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_')_,
- an incorrect guesses counter,
- a virtual keyboard,

4. The user must be able to use **both virtual** _(by clicking letter keys on the screen)_ and **physical keyboards** _(by pressing letter keys on their keyboard)_ to play the game.
5. When the user starts guessing the letters:

- whenever the letter is guessed correctly, this letter appears **instead of the corresponding underscore(s)** _(for the example mentioned above, if the user clicks or presses the 'd' letter, both 'd's must appear on the screen: '\_ d d \_ \_ \_ \_')_;
- if the letter is not in the word, **one body part** must be added to the gallows and the incorrect guesses counter **must be updated** accordingly;
- the clicked/pressed letter **must be disabled** and it must be reflected in the UI _(for example, by using a different color on the disabled button)_;

6. The body parts appear on the gallows in the **following order**: head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg. It means that the user has **6 attempts** to guess the word.
7. The player will continue guessing letters until either **the word is solved** or **all six body parts** are on the gallows.
8. At the end of the game, a **modal window** must appear. It must:

- include the **message** that either congratulates the user on winning the game or informs them that they failed to win;
- the **secret word** (even if it was guessed correctly);
- a **"play again"** button.

9. When the user clicks on "play again", the game **starts over**:

- the gallows is **empty**;
- the question is **changed**;
- the underscores are **updated** according to the new secret word _(the same secret word can't be used as an answer to more than one question)_;
- an incorrect guesses counter is **set to 0**.

### Approximate appearance

_This example is purely illustrative. Feel free to change the layout as you wish._

### Helpful materials

At the [following link](https://www.figma.com/file/ug2NAUiXPpaFDvch5TWUxd/Hangman-game?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4Gj7Ayo0yckppNo8-1) you will find:

- examples of the game flow,
- body parts (for those who don't want to design them by themselves).

### Main functional requirements

- The design must be **adaptive (or responsive)**, that includes desktop(1440px <= width), tablet(768px <= width < 1440px) and mobile(360px <= width < 768px). When switching between versions everything must be displayed correctly, all functionality must be present, no content must disappear or be left beyond the screen.
- Initially, `body` in the `index.html` file **must be empty**, all necessary elements are generated using JS.
- Both at the beginning and in the end of the game, the question-answer pair must be **chosen randomly** _(it's recommended to have at least 10 question-answer pairs)_.
- The application can be done **in English or in Russian**.

## Repository requirements

- The task must be done in **\*private school's repository**.
- The code must be committed to a separate branch **named as the task**.
- The `main` (or old style master) branch **must be empty** (contain only files like README.md or .gitignore).
- Commit messages must follow the [guideline](https://docs.rs.school/#/git-convention)
- Once the work is finished, create a pull request from a **hangman** branch to **main** (or master).
- The pull request name must contain **the task name**.
- The pull request description must be provided according to the [template](https://docs.rs.school/#/pull-request-review-process?id=Требования-к-pull-request-pr).

## Technical requirements

- The application is displayed correctly and functions properly in the latest version of Google Chrome.
- It is **not allowed** to use:
  - CSS frameworks (e.g., `Bootstrap`),
  - JS frameworks (e.g., `Angular`, `React`, `Vue`, etc.),
  - Outdated libraries (e.g. `JQuery`, etc.),
  - Any JS libraries which are not devDependencies (e.g. `lodash`),
  - `TypeScript`.
- You can use CSS preprocessors (`SASS`, `SCSS`) and `normalize.css`.
- It is strongly recommended to use `eslint` and `prettier`.

## CrossCheck Criteria (150 points)

_It is recommended to print the secret word in the browser's console to facilitate the cross-check process._

- [ ] Responsive/adaptive UI from 1440px to 360px viewport: `+10`
- [ ] The generation of DOM elements is implemented. `body` in the `index.html` is empty (can contain only `script` tag). _This requirement can be checked by pressing `Ctrl+U` (Windows) or `Option(⌥)+Command(⌘)+U` (Mac)_: `+20`
- [ ] The game starts with the correct default view (empty gallows, underscores for secret word, etc.) and a random question: `+5`
- [ ] The user can play the game by using the virtual keyboard: `+20`
- [ ] The user can play the game by using the physical keyboard: `+20`
- [ ] When the letter is correct, it appears instead of the corresponding underscore. If the letter repeats in the word, all corresponding underscores must be replaced by it: `+15`
- [ ] When the letter is incorrect:
  - [ ] the incorrect guesses counter is updated: `+5`
  - [ ] a body part is added to the gallows: `+10`
- [ ] The clicked/pressed letter is disabled: `+5`
- [ ] The body parts appear on the gallows in the logical order (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg): `+5`
- [ ] When the user runs out of 6 attempts or wins the game, the modal window appears: `+10`
- [ ] The modal window includes the message about the game's outcome (winning or losing), the secret word and the 'play again' button: `+10`
- [ ] When the user clicks the 'play again' button, the game starts over by showing a new question and resetting the gallows, the incorrect guesses counter and the underscores for the secret word: `+15`

## Penalties:

- The question-answer pair remains the same upon refreshing the page _(please, refresh the page **multiple times** to verify this requirement)_: `-20`
- When clicking on 'play again' button, the newly selected question-answer pair is identical to the previous one: `-20`
- When clicking on 'play again' button, the elements on the page are reset by reloading the page instead of updating them dynamically: `-50`
- `body` in the `index.html` is not empty (contains something else besides the allowed `script` tag): `-150`
- Anything mentioned as **not allowed** in the 'Technical requirements' section is used: `-150`

**!!!** The administration reserves the right to invalidate a student's score for the task if any of the mandatory requirements are not fulfilled in a proper manner _(e.g. if the student has used html templates to generate the `body` content)_.
