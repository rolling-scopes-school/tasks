# [Stage#2.](../../) Functional Programming Basics

## Module Overview 📚

This module provides students with a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts in functional programming. Throughout the module, students will explore key principles such as pure functions, immutability, recursion, and advanced techniques like currying, partial application, and memoization.  
By the end of the module, students will gain insights into applying these concepts to real-world application development, enabling them to develop solutions more adeptly and effectively.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Grasp the concept of pure functions
- Acquire knowledge of immutability concept, encompassing functions as first-class entities, functions composition, and higher-order functions
- Delve into recursion
- Explore currying, partial application, and memoization

## Approximate Module Completion Time ⏱️
