# [Stage#2.](../../) Event Loop & Animation

## Module Overview üìö

This module introduces students to the Event Loop and Animation concepts in web development. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how JavaScript handles asynchronous events and the principles behind creating animations using CSS3. The module covers topics ranging from understanding the Event Loop to mastering CSS3 animations.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand the Event Loop mechanism in JavaScript, including its components like the Call Stack, Web APIs, and Callback Queue.
- Grasp the concept of single-threaded execution and how JavaScript handles concurrency through asynchronous operations.
- Learn about CSS3 Transitions and Transforms for creating animations.
- Explore techniques such as requestAnimationFrame and addressing performance issues in animations.
