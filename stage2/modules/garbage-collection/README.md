# [Stage#2.](../../) JavaScript Garbage Collection üóëÔ∏è

## Module Overview üìö

This module delves into the concept of garbage collection in JavaScript, focusing on how JavaScript automatically manages memory. The course aims to provide a clear understanding of the mechanisms JavaScript uses to identify and free unused memory, a process critical for optimizing application performance and preventing memory leaks.

## Learning Objectives üéØ

Students will:

- Understand what garbage collection is and why it is necessary in JavaScript.
- Learn about the main algorithms used for garbage collection in JavaScript, such as mark-and-sweep and reference counting.
- Explore common scenarios that lead to memory leaks and how to avoid them.
- Gain practical skills in identifying potential memory management issues in JavaScript code.
