## Technical Screening 🗣️

Technical Screening or the process of a mentor recruiting students for their group.

## Interview Objectives 🎯

- Forming a list of students for RSSchool stage#2.
- Creating subgroups of "Mentor-Students".
  Each mentor interviews more people than they plan to mentor (For example, +2 students).
  After all interviews, a mentor can dismiss part of the group to retain the number of students they can mentor. Mentors may delay dismissal for a few weeks to make a more considered decision.
- Checking the students' level of preparation.
- Providing students with interview experience.

## Attention! RS School does not pre-check 🚫

- Mentors' adequacy
- Students' adequacy

## Number of Students and Invitation Order 📝

The number of students invited for interviews depends on the number of mentors who have signed up for the course.
For example, in RSSchool 2021Q1 (winter 2021), 247 people registered as mentors. 1101 interviews were conducted. 691 students continued studying with a mentor in the second stage.

Students receive invitations in the following order:

1. By the recommendation of a mentor, if the mentor is ready to mentor these students.
2. Based on the results of the first stage of the course.

## Interview Process 🔄

Interviews take place during the first three weeks of RSSchool stage#2.
You can track current interview information at [app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school) in the `Interviews` section. Here you will find a link to the interview description, the interview deadline, and a registration button.

### Stages

1. **Registration** 📌. To participate in the interview selection, the student must click the `Register` button. If an Interviewer is already displayed for the student, there is no need to click the button; they should contact the interviewer.
2. **Pairing** 👥. After distribution, students will see their Interviewer — a link to their account at [app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school) with contact details. The student must contact the interviewer within the first week to agree on an interview date.
   If an Interviewer does not appear for the student, they are not invited for an interview and are automatically moved to the wait-list.
3. **Conducting the Interview** 💬. The interview can be conducted online. The average interview duration is ~60 minutes.
4. **Interview Results** 📊. After a student completes the interview, the `Result` column will contain the mentor's decision: Yes — the mentor takes the student; otherwise, the student is moved to the wait-list.

**Wait-list** 📃 — a list of students who were either not invited for an interview or were rejected by a mentor after the interview. From this list, mentors can recruit additional students if possible.
**Redistribution** 🔁. Additional redistributions may be conducted at the administration's discretion, involving students from the wait-list.

## What Students Should Do if They Fail the Interview 😟

### Question: How can a student switch to another mentor? 🔄

The course does not provide the option for students to choose a mentor.
