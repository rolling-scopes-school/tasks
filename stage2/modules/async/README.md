# [Stage#2.](../../) Async Programming

## Module Overview 📚

This module equips students with essential skills in handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Students will dive into the core concepts of asynchronicity, mastering Promises and Async/Await techniques. By the end of the module, students will be adept at managing asynchronous tasks, making asynchronous requests, and handling errors effectively.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

In this module, students will:

- Gain an understanding of why and how to use asynchronicity
- Dive into asynchronous programming with Promises, including:
  - Grasping the concept of Promises
  - Writing code using Promises
  - Managing successful Promises
  - Handling rejected Promises
  - Bundling multiple Promises
- Explore asynchronous programming using Async/Await, including:
  - Making asynchronous requests and functions
  - Understanding the asynchronous/awaiting model
  - Writing code using async/await
  - Dealing with errors using async/await
- Familiarize themselves with fetch and XMLHTTPRequest
