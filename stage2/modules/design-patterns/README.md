# [Stage#2.](../../) Design Patterns 🏗️

## Module Overview 📚

The "Design Patterns" module delves into the foundational principles of software design patterns, categorizing them into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. This module aims to equip students with the knowledge to apply these patterns in various programming scenarios, enhancing code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

Students will:

- Understand the concept and importance of design patterns in software development.
- Explore and apply creational design patterns to solve common problems related to object creation.
- Learn about structural design patterns and their use in designing flexible and efficient software architecture.
- Delve into behavioral design patterns to manage complex control flows and communication between objects.
- Gain practical experience by implementing design patterns in programming projects.
