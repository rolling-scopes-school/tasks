# Decision Making Tool

## Description

Your task is to implement a single page application (SPA) for decision making.  
This application is designed to help streamers, content makers, tabletop role-players to make random pick based on the weight of an option (it increases the chance of an option being picked).

The application consists of two parts: `List of Options` and `Decision Picker`.

The first part of the application (`List of Options`) allows you to edit the list of options, as well as to save it to a file and load it from a file. There is also a button to go to the second part of the application (`Decision Picker`).

The second part of the application (`Decision Picker`) allows you to visualize the previously created list. There is also an element for displaying the picked option, a button to start the picking process and a user-friendly option to return to the first part of the application (`List of Options`).

## Demo

> This is a demo of the app's functionality.  
> The app design is up to you as long as it meets the requirements of the assignment.

## Task Objectives

- Acquire or refine skills in creating, modifying, and deleting HTML elements dynamically using code.
- Practice on implementing SPA with seamless navigation between different parts of the application _(e.g., via `Hash Router`/`History Api Router` strategy)_.
- Practice storing user input between sessions _(e.g., via `Web Storage API`)_.
- Learn to collect and save user input data to a file.
- Learn to load and process data from a file _(e.g., via `File API`)_.
- Familiarize yourself with Canvas API.
- Practice with animations. _(e.g., via `Web API`'s `requestAnimationFrame`, `Animations API`, etc.)_
- Familiarize yourself with setting up project configurations.
- Familiarize yourself with writing clean code with strict rules.

## Repository and Submission Requirements

- Use a [private school repository](https://rs.school/docs/ru/private-repository) to develop this application.

4. (+4) `package.json` must contain `stylelint` script for checking project files.

#### Husky (10/80)

> `husky` allows us to run some code during various git events using git hooks.  
> `lint-staged` allows us to run linters/formatters only on code that is prepared for commit.  
> `commitlint` keeps track of commit names and allows us to avoid unnecessary `git rebase -i`.

1. (+2) [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), [`lint-staged`](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) and [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/) must be installed to developer dependencies.

### Code Quality (80 points)

> The use of innerHTML is prohibited. Use of DOM search methods (querySelector*, getElement*, etc.) is prohibited. ([there are good reasons for not using them](https://gist.github.com/TELEUZI/410d19772481d98b06e0b41ebf89fff1#naive-implementation-).)
>
> For creating elements that will need to be accessed by code, a great solution is to use `createElement` and variables. For clearing/replacing element content, `replaceChildren` may be useful. To add elements that will not need to be accessed by code, it is acceptable to use `insertAdjacentHTML`.
>
> This won't cause any pain if you at least just write a reusable function (or class) that takes in the necessary element settings (`tagName`, `className`, `textContent`, etc.) and returns a ready-to-use element (or component).

#### Code Smells (4/80)

1. (+2) The code does not contain magic (hardcoded) values. _([magic numbers](https://refactoring.guru/replace-magic-number-with-symbolic-constant), [magic strings](https://dev.to/josuews303/dont-use-magic-strings-2aol), etc.)_

#### Clear and Reusable Functions (16/80)

1. (+8) The code is divided into small functions (≤ 40 lines each or according to the mentor's preference) with clear names and purposes. The same applies to methods of classes. _(ESLint rule `max-lines-per-function` may be useful for this.)_
2. (+8) Arguments and return values of functions and methods are explicitly typed.

#### Care About Types (48/80)

> [There is no point in using TypeScript if you don’t care about types](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/there-is-no-point-to-use-typescript-in-your-project-if-you-dont-care-about-types-68131deeb43a)  
> Type assertions (`x as SomeType`) and non-nullability assertions (`y!`) are unsafe. Both only silence the TypeScript compiler, but do not insert any runtime checks to match these assertions, so they can cause your program to crash at runtime.

1. (+8) The code does not contain any type assertions.
2. (+8) The code does not contain any non-nullability assertions.
3. (+16) The code does not contain any explicit or implicit `any`.
4. (+16) The code contains and uses [type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) _(e.g., type narrowing type predicates, assertion functions, etc.)_. _(small hint: functions to get data from a json file and/or localStorage are great places to apply type guards.)_

4. (+8) The width (angle) of each `option section` must depend on the `weight` field of the option. _The main idea of this feature is that by setting the weight value of the option we can adjust the chance of that particular option being picked. That is, the higher the weight of the option, the wider its section, and therefore the higher the chance of being picked._
5. (+2) Each `option section` must have a visual boundary to distinguish it from other elements (e.g., adjacent sections, cursor, center element), even if their fill colors are similar. _(Additional stroke, shadow, fill can be useful here.)_

4. (+2) Each displayed `option section title` must have a visual boundary to distinguish it from the randomized `option section` fill color. _(Additional stroke, shadow, fill can be useful here.)_

##### Center element

1. (+2) In the center of the `wheel`, there must be a decorative element to hide the point of contact between all the option sections _(e.g., a small circle, star, image, etc.)_.
2. (+2) The `center element` must have a visual boundary to distinguish it from other elements (e.g., adjacent sections), even if their fill colors are similar. _(Additional stroke, shadow, fill can be useful here.)_

##### Cursor

1. (+4) The `wheel` element must display a `cursor` that points to the current option. It can be designed in the form of a triangle, arrow or any similar figure with a clearly defined pointer.
2. (+2) The `cursor` must be placed at any position on the edge of the `wheel` and not overlapped by other elements.
3. (+2) The `cursor` must have a visual boundary to distinguish it from other elements (e.g., adjacent sections, background), even if their fill colors are similar. _(Additional stroke, shadow, fill can be useful here.)_

##### Decision Picking

1. (+2) When decision picking is initiated, the wheel must start rotating and stop after a short duration.
2. (+4) The rotation duration must be specified by the `duration` element. That is, it should correspond to its value (in seconds) at the moment of rotation start. _Be loyal when crosschecking. A small inaccuracy is acceptable. There is no need to reduce points for a difference of a couple of seconds._
3. (+4) The rotation should have a non-linear velocity. Use a suitable easing _(e.g. `ease-in-out` or `ease-in-out-back` with a tiny magnitude)_.
4. (+4) The wheel must perform several full turns (minimum 5) and stop at a random point on the circumference _(at a random position on the random option section)_.
5. (+2) A `finish sound` must be played when `picking state` is changed to `picked state` if `mute state` is toggled `on`.
6. (+2) A `finish sound` must not be played if `mute state` is toggled `off`.
7. (+4) In the `picking state`, `option sections` must not change their order, shape, color. _It means that visually the `option sections` shall rotate as an indivisible whole wheel._
8. (+4) In the `picking state`, each `option section title` shall not change its location relative to the boundaries of its `option section`. _It means that visually `option section title` and `option section` should rotate as an indivisible element._
9. (+2) In the `picking state`, the `cursor` must stay in its place and not rotate.

### Error page (4 points)

#### General (4/4)

1. (+1) Implemented `Error page` display if the user is on an unknown route.
2. (+1) The `Error page` displays a `back button` for navigating to the [`List of Options` route](#list-of-options-108-points). The appearance of this button should clearly indicate its purpose _(contain appropriate text or icon. e.g., "Back", "Back to main page", "⬅", "↖" etc.)_.
3. (+2) The `back button` click must navigate to the `List of Options` route.
