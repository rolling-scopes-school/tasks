## Task «Fun Chat»

What could be better than chatting with your friends using a chat app?<br>
But what if the service owner deletes your messages? Or, on the contrary, they can store your chat history without your consent!<br>
You know how to create an outstanding design and functionality, right? Let's not delay and get down to work! Let's create our own chat.
We've found a ready-made [server application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main) and got a [detailed description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main#readme) for it.

## Task Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with the WebSocket connection protocol.
- Gain experience working with a connection where both the client and server applications can initiate sending messages.
- Refine and solidify your skills in asynchronous coding.
- Enhance and consolidate your skills in working with the Document Object Model (DOM) and creating markup using code.

- [WebSockets Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)

## Setting Up for Development / Preparing for Development

Before initiating the development of the client application, you have to clone the [server application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main) to your local computer, launch the local server, and maintain the server application's operation as needed.

**Important!** If for any reason you have changed the port which your client application will use and it is different from the one suggested in the server application settings, be sure to notify your reviewers.

To complete the task in the school repository, create a separate branch and regularly commit your solutions to it.

You have complete freedom to implement any visual design for the application. You will find a sample of a possible app design [here](https://mikaleinik.github.io/chat-deploy).

## Functional Requirements (+250)

#### 1. User Authentication Page (+30)

1. (+5) The login field is checked by a validator. The validator must be different from the password applied in the field. The selection of validation criteria and their display options is at the student's discretion. An empty string validator is not acceptable.
2. (+5) The password field is checked by a validator. The validator must be different from the one used in the login field. The selection of validation criteria and their display options is at the student's discretion. An empty string validator is not acceptable.
3. (+5) The user is unable to submit an authentication request with data that has not passed validation.

4. (+5) In the absence of message history, a message in the message history field indicates that this is the beginning of the dialogue.
5. (+5) When sending a message to another user, the message history scrolls to the sent message (making the just-sent message visible to the user).
6. (+5) When receiving a message from another user in an open dialogue, the message history scrolls to the received message (making the just-received message visible to the user).
7. (+5) When opening a dialogue with unread messages, new messages are separated from the read messages by a dividing line, and the user can see the dividing line and at least one unread message. When receiving new unread messages in an open dialogue, the line must always stay within the dialogue area and not hide in the scroll area until the conditions to remove it are met.
8. (+5) The dividing line between read and unread messages in an open dialogue can be removed by each of the following actions: when scrolling the message history area, after clicking the message send button, or clicking inside the message history area.

## FAQ

_Question_ - Is the use of CSS framework allowed?

_Answer_ - Yes, it is allowed.

_Question_ - Is the use of style preprocessors such as SCSS, SASS, etc. allowed?

_Answer_ - Yes, it is allowed.

_Question_ - Is the appearance of the application evaluated?

_Answer_ - Only the criteria specified in the [interface section](#10-interface-and-visual-design-15) are assessed; students are free to choose every other aspect of the design themselves.

_Question_ - Is a validator that checks for an empty string on authorization allowed?

_Answer_ - No, it's not allowed. Your validation form must not submit blank fields and must additionally check any other criteria.

_Question_ - How should the task be assessed if the information in a particular element is not updated according to the actions of other users or the server?

_Answer_ - Elements containing current information must be promptly updated. Simply having such elements does not mean meeting the requirement. For example, user activity must always reflect their relevant current status. If component updates only occur after a page refresh, then the requirements clause is not met.

_Question_ - How should message statuses ("delivered"/"read") change when we have a large number of messages?

_Answer_ - Status changes must occur simultaneously for all relevant messages. For example, during authentication and fetching the list of messages, all previously undelivered messages must have their status changed to "delivered". Similarly, actions necessary for the "read" status must update all unread messages to "read."

_Question_ - If a user enters a very long name, how can the requirements of the interface points be met?

_Answer_ - It is not considered a layout issue if only the first 10 characters of a long username are displayed in the input field (or another element containing the username). However, elements overlay is not allowed. In case of disputed interpretation due to the varying width of uppercase and lowercase characters, you have to check this requirement by entering the value "0123456789".

_Question_ - If a user sends a very long message, how can the requirements of the interface points be met?

_Answer_ - The complete message must be displayed in the dialogue. If a new message is too long you should be able to see the beginning of the message and all the text that fits in the dialog area.

_Question_ - What pages are available to a non-authorized user?

_Answer_ - They have access to the Authentication and About pages.

_Question_ - How to check page access points if no routing is implemented?

_Answer_ - You perform any action to go to a page where the user is supposed to be not allowed to proceed according to the requirements. If you fail to do so, the requirements have been met. It is not allowed to modify the markup or inject your own scripts for transition attempts.

_Question_ - Is it necessary to clear the message entry field when selecting a dialog with another user?

_Answer_ - Yes, it's necessary to clean.

_Question_ - Should the message history be restored when reconnection is restored?

_Answer_ - No, message history is not restored after the connection is restored, only users authorized at the time of connection restoration.

_Question_ - How do I simulate a loss of connection to the server when performing a cross-check?

_Answer_ - Only by stopping the local server and restarting it.

_Question_ - Which message is considered empty?

_Answer_ - A message that contains nothing, not a single character. The length of such a message is zero characters.

_Question_ - Is it acceptable to replace the username in your posts with "you"?

_Answer_ - Yes.
