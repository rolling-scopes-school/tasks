## Task «Fun Chat»

What could be better than chatting with your friends using a chat app?<br>
But what if the service owner deletes your messages? Or, on the contrary, they can store your chat history without your consent!<br>
You know how to create an outstanding design and functionality, right? Let's not delay and get down to work! Let's create our own chat.
We've found a ready-made [server application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main) and got a [detailed description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main#readme) for it.

## Task Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with the WebSocket connection protocol.
- Gain experience working with a connection where both the client and server applications can initiate sending messages.
- Refine and solidify your skills in asynchronous coding.
- Enhance and consolidate your skills in working with the Document Object Model (DOM) and creating markup using code.

- [WebSockets Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)

## Setting Up for Development / Preparing for Development

Before initiating the development of the client application, you have to clone the [server application](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server/tree/main) to your local computer, launch the local server, and maintain the server application's operation as needed.

**Important!** If for any reason you have changed the port which your client application will use and it is different from the one suggested in the server application settings, be sure to notify your reviewers.

To complete the task in the school repository, create a separate branch and regularly commit your solutions to it.

You have complete freedom to implement any visual design for the application. You will find a sample of a possible app design [here](https://mikaleinik.github.io/chat-deploy).

## Functional Requirements (+250)

## FAQ

_Question_ - Is the use of CSS framework allowed?

_Answer_ - Yes, it is allowed.

_Question_ - Is the use of style preprocessors such as SCSS, SASS, etc. allowed?

_Answer_ - Yes, it is allowed.

_Question_ - Is the appearance of the application evaluated?

_Answer_ - Only the criteria specified in the [interface section](#10-interface-and-visual-design-15) are assessed; students are free to choose every other aspect of the design themselves.

_Question_ - How should the task be assessed if the information in a particular element is not updated according to the actions of other users or the server?

_Answer_ - Elements containing current information must be promptly updated. Simply having such elements does not mean meeting the requirement. For example, user activity must always reflect their relevant current status.

_Question_ - How should message statuses ("delivered"/"read") change when we have a large number of messages?

_Answer_ - Status changes must occur simultaneously for all relevant messages. For example, during authentication and fetching the list of messages, all previously undelivered messages must have their status changed to "delivered". Similarly, actions necessary for the "read" status must update all unread messages to "read."

_Question_ - If a user enters a very long name, how can the requirements of the interface points be met?

_Answer_ - It is not considered a layout issue if only the first 10 characters of a long username are displayed in the input field (or another element containing the username). However, elements overlay is not allowed. In case of disputed interpretation due to the varying width of uppercase and lowercase characters, you have to check this requirement by entering the value "0123456789".

_Question_ - If a user sends a very long message, how can the requirements of the interface points be met?

_Answer_ - The complete message must be displayed in the dialogue.

_Question_ - What pages are available to a non-authorized user?

_Answer_ - They have access to the Authentication and About pages.

_Question_ - Is it necessary to clear the message entry field when selecting a dialog with another user?

_Answer_ - Yes, it's necessary to clean.

_Question_ - Should the message history be restored when reconnection is restored?

_Answer_ - No, message history is not restored after the connection is restored, only users authorized at the time of connection restoration.

_Question_ - How do I simulate a loss of connection to the server when performing a cross-check?

_Answer_ - Only by stopping the local server and restarting it.
