# 🛠️ RSS Testing

## Overview

Embark on a journey to enhance your JavaScript testing skills by integrating Jest and DOM Testing Library into a real-world project. This task, centered around the [Movie App Testing](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/movie-app-testing) project, is designed to introduce you to the essentials of unit testing and UI testing in JavaScript applications. Mastering these testing frameworks will empower you to write more reliable, bug-free code.

## Objectives

- **Incorporate Testing Frameworks**: Integrate Jest for unit testing and DOM Testing Library for UI testing to ensure your application functions correctly under various scenarios.
- **Configuration and Setup**: Learn to configure your testing environment properly and set up necessary scripts in `package.json` to streamline your testing workflow.
- **Achieve Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Aim to write tests that cover critical functionalities of the application, improving its stability and reliability.

## Key Features

1. **Testing Integration**: Learn the ropes of integrating Jest and DOM Testing Library into an existing project to start building your test suite.
2. **Script Configuration**: Set up your `package.json` to include scripts for running tests, making it easier to execute and manage tests as you develop.

## Technical Requirements

- **Repository Management**: Instead of cloning the original repository, copy the files from the [Movie App Testing repository](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/movie-app-testing) and add them to the branch named `rss-testing` of your private school repository.
- **Familiarize and Install**: Get to know the project structure and install all necessary dependencies for Jest and DOM Testing Library to begin writing your tests.

## Resources

- **Jest Documentation**: Dive into the [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) to understand the fundamentals of testing with Jest.
- **DOM Testing Library Docs**: Explore the [Testing Library Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro) for guidance on using DOM Testing Library effectively.
- **Project Repository**: Access the project on GitHub through the [Movie App Testing Repository](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/movie-app-testing) to commence your testing journey.

# 🗂️ Repository Management Guidelines

## Overview

These guidelines are established for students embarking on the testing task. You are tasked with managing your work within a private school repository, adhering to a structured process for organizing and conducting your tests.

## Repository Preparation Steps

To prepare for the "RSS Testing" task within your private school repository, simply follow these steps:

1. **Branch Creation**:

   - **Start Fresh**: Create a new branch named `rss-testing` directly from the `main` or `master` branch of your private school repository. This will serve as the dedicated workspace for your testing activities.

2. **Code Placement**:

   - **Organize**: Copy the source code of the application into the `rss-testing` branch. This ensures that all testing efforts are centralized within this branch, facilitating a focused and organized approach to writing and managing tests

## Conducting Your Tests

- **Test Execution**: Perform your tests within the context of the pull request, utilizing it as a platform for documenting and reviewing your testing progress.
- **Ensure Thorough Coverage**: Your testing should be comprehensive, covering all critical aspects of the application as outlined in the objectives.
- **Utilize Feedback Mechanisms**: Leverage GitHub's commenting capabilities to note down any observations or insights gained during testing.

# 🚀 Finalizing and Submitting Your Task

## Completion and Presentation

- **Wrap Up Your Testing**: Once your testing is thorough and complete, prepare your pull request for final evaluation.
- **Submission Process**: Submit your pull request link through the student dashboard on the RS App, ensuring it's included in the appropriate submission section.

## Important Submission Notes

- **Official Submission Method**: The link to your pull request is your task's official submission point.
- **Detailing Your Work**: Make sure your pull request comprehensively documents your testing efforts and any findings.
- **Accessibility for Evaluation**: There's no need to merge the pull request; it should remain accessible for mentor review.
