# 🗂️ Working with Repository Rules

## Overview

These detailed guidelines are crafted for students undertaking the code review task. You are required to work within a private school repository, ensuring a structured and professional approach to manage your code review process.

## Repository Management

1. **Branch Creation**:
   - **Start Fresh**: Create a new branch named `code-review` from the `main` or `master` branch of your private school repository.
2. **Code Placement**:
   - **Organize**: Place the code of the application to be reviewed in the `code-review` branch.
3. **Pull Request**:
   - **Initiate Review**: Create a pull request from the `code-review` branch to the `main` or `master` branch. This will be your platform for conducting the code review.

## Conducting the Code Review

- **In-Depth Analysis**: Execute the code review directly within the pull request.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure your review is exhaustive, addressing all aspects as per the task evaluation criteria.
- **Engaging Feedback**: Utilize GitHub's commenting features to add insightful review comments on specific code lines or sections as needed.
