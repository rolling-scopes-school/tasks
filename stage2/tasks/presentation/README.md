# 🎤 Presentation Assignment Overview

Prepare a captivating presentation 🌟 on a topic selected from the provided list or one that receives your mentor's approval.

## 📝 Selecting Your Topic

To kick-start your preparation, choose a topic 🎯 from the comprehensive list available at [this link](presentation-topics.md). It's crucial to select a topic that resonates with you and can engage your audience effectively.

## 📊 Presentation Requirements

To ensure your presentation hits the mark, adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Duration**: Aim for a presentation length of 8–10 minutes ⏱️, striking the perfect balance between depth and engagement.
- **Preparation**: Conduct a thorough speech rehearsal 🗣️, either with your mentor or within your mentor's group, to refine your delivery.
- **Speaker Notes**: Equip each slide with detailed speaker notes 📝 to guide your delivery and ensure no key point is missed.
- **Language**: Use English 🇬🇧 for both your slides and speech to maintain clarity and reach a broader audience.
- **Tools**: Leverage the [HTML Presentation Framework Reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for crafting your slides, adding a professional touch to your presentation. Usage of platforms like `slides.com` or similar is **not permitted**; you must use native Reveal.js to create your slides.

## 📈 Evaluation Criteria

### Basic Scope (100 points)

Achieve a full score by fulfilling all the steps outlined below:

1. **Presentation Creation**: Utilize _Reveal_ for your slides, ensuring both slides and speech transcript are in English.
2. **Speech Recording**: English recording is mandatory, with two acceptable methods:
   - **Camera Option**: Record using any camera device 📷, ensuring both your face and slides are visible. [Here's a great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JezLAu4751Y&feature=youtu.be).
   - **Software Option**: Use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or similar software for recording, with requirements matching the camera option.
3. **Video Upload**: Post your recorded presentation to YouTube, setting it to _unlisted_ if privacy is a concern, and link your slides in the video description.
4. **Documentation**: On your private school repository, create a `presentation` branch and a markdown file `presentation.md` containing:
   - YouTube video link;
   - Link to your Reveal slide deck;
   - (Optional) Presentation transcript link;
   - (Optional) Additional comments.
5. **Pull Request**: Submit your work via a Pull Request titled `presentation`, awaiting review without merging.

**Note**: Failure to use Reveal or reading off the presentation results in a score of **0 points**.
