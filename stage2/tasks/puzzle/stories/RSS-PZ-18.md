# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-18: Add Toggle/Button Functionality for Translation Hint (5 points)

## üìù Description

Enhance the game's user experience by adding a feature that allows players to choose the visibility of the translation hint using a toggle or button. This control should enable players to decide if the translation hint appears immediately with the sentence in the source data block or only after the sentence is correctly assembled.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Choice of Toggle or Button:**

   - Provide a toggle switch or button for players to control the translation hint visibility.
   - Clearly label this control for easy understanding and access.

2. **Conditional Display of Translation Hint:**

   - When the hint feature is enabled, display the translation at the same time as the sentence appears in the source data block.
   - If the hint is disabled, reveal the translation only after the sentence is correctly assembled.

3. **User Interface Integration:**

   - Integrate the toggle/button seamlessly within the game interface, ensuring it does not disrupt the gameplay.

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Provide clear visual feedback reflecting the current state of the translation hint (visible or hidden).

## üé® Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Design of Control Element:**

   - Style the toggle switch or button to align with the game's visual theme, using symbols like an eye or text for clarity.
   - Implement animations or color changes to indicate the active state of the control.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- A toggle switch or button is available for players to control the visibility of the translation hint.
- The translation hint's behavior aligns with the player's choice: immediate visibility or post-assembly reveal.
- Clear visual and interactive feedback is provided to indicate the current state of the hint.
