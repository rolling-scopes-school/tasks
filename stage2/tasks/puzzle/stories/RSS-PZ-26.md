# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-26: Visual Indicators for Completed and Pending Rounds and Levels (10 points)

## üìù Description

Enhance the game's interface by implementing visual indicators that distinguish between completed and pending rounds within each difficulty level. If the level and round selection is implemented as a dropdown menu, this can be achieved using different font colors or other visual cues. Additionally, ensure that a completed level is visually distinct from those that are not yet completed, aiding players in tracking their overall progress in the game.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Visual Indicators for Rounds:**

   - Design visual indicators such as color-coded font, checkmarks, or icons to differentiate completed rounds from pending ones.
   - If using a dropdown menu for round selection, use different font colors or styles to indicate the status of each round.

2. **Level Completion Indication:**

   - Implement a system to visually distinguish levels that have been fully completed from those that have not. This could involve color changes, badges, or other distinctive markers.

3. **Dynamic Updates and Integration:**

   - Ensure that the indicators for both rounds and levels update dynamically as the player progresses.
   - Integrate these indicators seamlessly into the selection interface, whether it‚Äôs a dropdown menu, buttons, or another format.

4. **Consistency Across Interface:**

   - Apply a consistent design approach to the visual indicators used for both levels and rounds for intuitive understanding.

## üé® Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Color-Coded Text or Icons:**

   - Use distinct colors for text or icons to show the status of rounds and levels. For example, green for completed and grey for pending.

2. **Badges or Symbols:**

   - Introduce badges, stars, or unique symbols to mark completed levels.

3. **Dropdown Menu Styling:**
   - If using a dropdown menu, style the options with different colors, fonts, or background highlights to reflect completion status.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Completed and pending rounds within each difficulty level are clearly indicated, possibly through color-coded font if using a dropdown menu.
- Levels that are fully completed are visually distinct from those that are not.
- The visual indicators are dynamically updated based on the player‚Äôs progress.
