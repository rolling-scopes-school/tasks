# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-27: Save Last Completed Round and Auto-Resume Functionality (5 points)

## üìù Description

Implement a feature to save the player's last completed round in local storage. Upon restarting the game, it should automatically commence from the next round in sequence. If the player completed the last round of a difficulty level, the game should start at the first round of the next level of difficulty. In case the player finished the last round of the highest difficulty level, the game should restart from the first round of the first difficulty level, ensuring continuous gameplay across sessions.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Saving Progress in Local Storage:**

   - After each round is completed, save the round and level information in the browser's local storage.

2. **Auto-Resume Logic:**

   - On restarting the game, retrieve the last completed round from local storage.
   - Automatically start the game from the next round or, if applicable, the next difficulty level.

3. **Handling Last Round and Level:**

   - If the last completed round was the final one in the current difficulty level, start the next game session at the first round of the subsequent level.
   - If it was the last round of the highest level, restart the game from the first round of the first difficulty level.

4. **User Interface Update:**

   - Update the game interface to reflect the resumed progress, including the current level and round.

## üé® Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Progress Indicators:**

   - Use visual cues like highlighted rounds or levels to indicate the player's current position in the game.

2. **Animation or Transition Effects:**

   - Incorporate smooth transitions or animations when the game auto-resumes to the next round or level.

3. **Informative Messages:**
   - Display a brief message or notification informing the player of the auto-resumed round or level.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- The game saves the player's last completed round and level in local storage.
- Upon game restart, it automatically resumes from the next round or the appropriate difficulty level.
- Clear indications are provided to the player regarding their resumed progress.
