# ⏱ Issue RSS-PZ-17: Implement Translation Hint Feature for Sentence Assembly (5 points)

## 📝 Description

Introduce a translation hint feature that displays the translation of the sentence that players are currently working to assemble. This hint aims to provide players with a linguistic reference, aiding them in understanding the structure and meaning of the sentence, which is particularly beneficial for language learning or challenging sentences.

## 🔨 Implementation Details

1. **Dynamic Translation Display:**

   - The translation should dynamically correspond to the sentence currently being assembled.

2. **UI Placement and Design:**

   - Consider subtle animations or effects for the hint's appearance and disappearance.

## 🎨 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Hint Design:**

   - Use a contrasting yet harmonious color scheme for the hint box to distinguish it from the game layout.
   - Employ readable fonts and appropriate text sizes.

2. **Interactive Elements:**

   - Add an icon or symbol (like a lightbulb or a question mark) that players can click or hover over to view the hint.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- A feature is available for players to access the translation of the sentence being assembled.
- The translation hint is presented in a non-intrusive, user-friendly manner.
