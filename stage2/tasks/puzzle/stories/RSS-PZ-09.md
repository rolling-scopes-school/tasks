# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-09: Dynamic Sizing of Word Cards Based on Word Length (5 points)

## üìù Description

Implement dynamic sizing for each word card on the main game page, ensuring that the size of the card adjusts automatically to match the length of the word it represents. This feature is key to providing a visually consistent and responsive user experience, as it accommodates different word lengths gracefully within the UI.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Dynamic Width Calculation:**

   - Calculate the width of each word card based on the number of characters in the word.
   - Ensure that the card size is proportionate to the word length, allowing for adequate spacing around the text.

2. **Responsive Card Design:**

   - Word cards should be responsive, adjusting their size not just to the word length but also to varying screen sizes and resolutions.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Card Size:**

   - Define minimum and maximum sizes for the word cards to ensure readability and aesthetic consistency.

4. **Font Size Adjustment:**

   - Adjust the font size within each card dynamically if needed, ensuring that longer words are still legible.

5. **Consistent Padding and Margins:**

   - Maintain consistent padding and margin around the text in each card, regardless of the word length.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Each word card dynamically adjusts its size to match the length of the word it represents.
