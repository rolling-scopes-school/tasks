# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-31: Distinct 'Known' and 'Unknown' Sentence Sections on Statistics Page (10 points)

## üìù Description

On the statistics page, create two separate sections: one for sentences the player assembled correctly (labeled 'I know' or a similar affirmative label) and another for sentences revealed using the 'I don't know' button (labeled 'I don't know' or an equivalent label indicating unfamiliarity). These sections will categorize the player's performance, providing a clear reflection of their knowledge regardless of the number of attempts or hints used.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Section Creation and Labeling:**

   - Design two distinct sections on the statistics page.
   - Label them appropriately to reflect sentences the player knows ('I know' or similar) and does not know ('I don't know' or similar).

2. **Performance Categorization Logic:**

   - Develop logic to categorize sentences based on whether the player assembled them correctly or used the 'I don't know' button.
   - This categorization should be independent of the number of attempts or hints used.

3. **User Interface Design:**

   - Ensure each section is visually distinct and easily distinguishable.
   - Design the sections to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear headings and layout.

4. **Data Presentation:**

   - Present the sentences in each category in a way that is easy to understand, possibly listing them or using visual representations like icons.

## üé® Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Distinct Visual Themes:**

   - Use different colors, icons, or fonts to clearly differentiate between the 'Known' and 'Unknown' sections.

2. **List or Card Format:**

   - Display the sentences in a list or card format for clarity and ease of navigation.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Two distinct sections are present on the statistics page: one for 'Known' sentences and one for 'Unknown' sentences.
- Sentences are correctly categorized based on the player's performance.
- The sections are visually distinct and labeled appropriately.
