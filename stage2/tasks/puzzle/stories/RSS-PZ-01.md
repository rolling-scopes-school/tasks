# ‚è± Issue RSS-PZ-01: Create Mandatory Input Fields for First Name and Surname on Login Page (10 points)

## üìù Description

This task involves creating two distinct input fields on the user name entry page: one for entering the first name and the other for the surname. Both fields are mandatory for submission. A 'Login' button will be included on the page to facilitate the submission of the entered information.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Designing Input Fields:**

   - Add two input fields on the login page, distinctly labeled as 'First Name' and 'Surname'.
   - Ensure the fields are placed in a logical order, typically with the first name field above the surname field.

2. **Mandatory Fields:**

   - Configure both input fields to be required. This means the form cannot be submitted unless both fields contain data.

3. **Login Button:**

   - Introduce a 'Login' button below the surname field.
   - The button should initially be in a default state, becoming fully interactive once the form requirements are met.

4. **Styling and Layout:**
   - Ensure the input fields and 'Login' button are clearly visible and accessible.
   - Opt for a clean and minimal design to avoid user distraction or confusion.

## üé® Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Input Fields Styling:**

   - Use a consistent and readable font.
   - Employ subtle borders or shading to define the input areas clearly.

2. **Login Button Design:**
   - Make the button visually appealing and appropriately sized.
   - Consider a color that stands out from the page‚Äôs background but is harmonious with the overall color scheme.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- The user name entry page includes two separate input fields for the first name and surname.
- Both input fields are configured as mandatory for form submission.
- A 'Login' button is present and appropriately positioned on the page.
- The input fields and 'Login' button are styled for clear visibility and user interaction.
