# TypeScript Essentials

## Overview

Dive into the world of TypeScript and enhance your JavaScript skills with this comprehensive learning path. We've handpicked a series of modules from Microsoft Learn to provide you with a deep understanding of TypeScript's capabilities. Your goal is to complete each module, earn badges, and compile these badges in a Markdown (MD) file as a testament to your TypeScript expertise.

### üìå Important Note

- The name on each badge must match the student's GitHub username to ensure accurate recognition and record-keeping.

## Reflections

[Add your personal reflections on what you learned in each module and how it contributes to your development skills]
```

## üöÄ Working with Repository Rules

### Repository Setup

1. **Private School Repository**: All work must be done in a private school repository.

### Branch Management

1. **Create Branch**: Begin by creating a new branch `typescript-essentials` from the `main` branch.

### Pull Requests

1. **Open Pull Request**: Once you complete a module, open a pull request (PR) from `typescript-essentials` to `main`.
2. **PR Description**: Format the PR description in accordance with the [PR Description requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/en/pull-request-review-process?id=description-example).

## üíº Task Submission to Cross-Check Rules

1. **Cross-Check Submission**: Submit your task for cross-check by deploying your Markdown file with all your badges and reflections to `gh-pages`. Submit the link to the deployed Markdown file on `gh-pages` for cross-check evaluation in the RS App.

### Evaluation Criteria: üìã

### CrossCheck Criteria (50 points): ‚úÖ
