# TypeScript Essentials

## Overview

Dive into the world of TypeScript and enhance your JavaScript skills with this comprehensive learning path. We've handpicked a series of modules from Microsoft Learn to provide you with a deep understanding of TypeScript's capabilities. Your goal is to complete each module, earn badges, and compile these badges in a Markdown (MD) file as a testament to your TypeScript expertise.

### 📌 Important Note

- The name on each badge must match the student's GitHub username to ensure accurate recognition and record-keeping.

## Reflections

[Add your personal reflections on what you learned in each module and how it contributes to your development skills]

## 🚀 Working with Repository Rules

### Repository Setup

1. **Private Personal Repository**: Create a new **private personal** repository `typescript-essentials`. All work must be done in a **private personal** repository.

### Branch Management

1. Create a new branch `gh-pages` from the `main` branch.
2. Create a new branch `typescript-essentials` from the `main` branch.
3. In the `typescript-essentials` branch, create a `badges-compilation.md` file.

### Pull Requests

1. Once you complete a module, **open and merge** a pull request (PR) from `typescript-essentials` to `gh-pages` for deployment.
2. Once you complete a module, **open and don't merge** a pull request (PR) from `typescript-essentials` to `main`. Format the PR description in accordance with the [PR Description requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/en/pull-request-review-process?id=description-example).

## 💼 Task Submission to Cross-Check Rules

Due to the fact that the repository is private, the link to the deployment will not work. If you did everything as described in the `Branch Management` section, then the deployment link will look like this `https://<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/typescript-essentials/badges-compilation`

### !!! Note !!!

Before cross-check begins, make the repository public and make sure that the link to the deployment works.

1.  Submit the link to the deployed Markdown file on `gh-pages` for cross-check evaluation in the RS App.

### Evaluation Criteria: 📋

### CrossCheck Criteria (50 points): ✅

## 🌟 Final Goal

Upon completing these modules, you'll not only deepen your understanding of TypeScript but also have a personalized showcase of your learning journey. This documentation will serve as a valuable asset in your portfolio, demonstrating your commitment and expertise in TypeScript.

Best of luck, and happy learning!
