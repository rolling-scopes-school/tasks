# TypeScript Essentials

## Overview

Dive into the world of TypeScript and enhance your JavaScript skills with this comprehensive learning path. We've handpicked a series of modules from Microsoft Learn to provide you with a deep understanding of TypeScript's capabilities. Your goal is to complete each module, earn badges, and compile these badges in a Markdown (MD) file as a testament to your TypeScript expertise.

### üìå Important Note

- The name on each badge must match the student's GitHub username to ensure accurate recognition and record-keeping.

8. **[Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/typescript-namespaces-organize-code/)**: Dive into organizing code effectively using namespaces.

### üìù Task Requirements

- **Complete Each Module**: Go through the modules thoroughly and absorb the concepts.
- **Earn Badges**: Each module completion will reward you with a badge. Collect these badges as proof of your learning.
- **Compile Badges in Markdown**:
  - Create an MD file where you'll list all the badges earned.
  - Ensure to link each badge to its corresponding module for easy reference.
  - Your Markdown file should be well-organized and visually appealing.

## Reflections

[Add your personal reflections on what you learned in each module and how it contributes to your development skills]
```

## üöÄ Working with Repository Rules

### Repository Setup

1. **Private Personal Repository**: Create a new **private personal** repository `typescript-essentials`. All work must be done in a **private personal** repository.

### Branch Management

1. Create a new branch `gh-pages` from the `main` branch.
2. Create a new branch `typescript-essentials` from the `main` branch.
3. In the `typescript-essentials` branch, create a `badges-compilation.md` file.

### Pull Requests

1. Once you complete a module, **open and merge** a pull request (PR) from `typescript-essentials` to `gh-pages` for deployment.
2. Once you complete a module, **open and don't merge** a pull request (PR) from `typescript-essentials` to `main`. Format the PR description in accordance with the [PR Description requirements](https://rs.school/docs/en/pull-request-review-process?id=description-example).

## üíº Task Submission to Cross-Check Rules

Due to the fact that the repository is private, the link to the deployment will not work. If you did everything as described in the `Branch Management` section, then the deployment link will look like this `https://<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/typescript-essentials/badges-compilation`

### !!! Note !!!

Before cross-check begins, make the repository public and make sure that the link to the deployment works.

1.  Submit the link to the deployed Markdown file on `gh-pages` for cross-check evaluation in the RS App.

### Evaluation Criteria: üìã

### CrossCheck Criteria (50 points): ‚úÖ

## üåü Final Goal

Upon completing these modules, you'll not only deepen your understanding of TypeScript but also have a personalized showcase of your learning journey. This documentation will serve as a valuable asset in your portfolio, demonstrating your commitment and expertise in TypeScript.

Best of luck, and happy learning!
