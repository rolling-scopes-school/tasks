# ‚è± Issue RSS-TSE-09: Compile Earned Badges in Markdown File (5 points)

## üìù Description

The objective of this task is to create a comprehensive Markdown file that lists all the earned badges from the TypeScript series. Each badge should be linked to its corresponding module, providing a consolidated and easy-to-reference documentation. This compilation serves as a testament to the skills acquired and milestones achieved in your TypeScript learning journey.

## üî® Implementation Details

1. **Markdown File Creation:**

   - Create a new Markdown file named `TypeScript-Badges-Compilation.md` or similar.
   - Organize the file in a clear and readable format, possibly using headings, bullet points, or tables.

2. **Badge Compilation:**

   - List each badge you have earned from the TypeScript module series.
   - Ensure that each badge is named descriptively to reflect the module it represents.

3. **Linking Badges to Modules:**

   - Provide a direct link for each badge to its corresponding module or the page where the badge was awarded.
   - Verify that all links are functional and direct to the correct module.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- A Markdown file is created compiling all earned TypeScript badges.
- Each badge in the list is linked to its corresponding module or badge award page.
- The file is well-organized and easy to navigate.
- All links in the Markdown file are functional and accurate.
