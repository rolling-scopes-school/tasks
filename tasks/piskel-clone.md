# Piskel-clone

## Functional requirements

You need to create a simplified clone of the https://www.piskelapp.com/, a web-based tool for Spriting and Pixel art.
An overview of the features can be found in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO3K3VFvlU6Akj3W29_nMLZFnwNOVbAzI

### Required functionality

#### Functional scope

- Canvas sizes: 32x32 / 64x64 / 128x128 user-defined units
- Tools
  - Pen. Required size is 1 unit. Other unit sizes (2, 3, 4) are optional.
  - Color select (Primary/Secondary)
  - Paint bucket should fill closed areas (flood fill)
  - Eraser
  - Stroke (to draw straight lines)
  - Paint all pixels of the same color
- Please use Tools in https://www.piskelapp.com/ as an ideal example of what should be done. Use only main functionality without keyboard modifiers (ALT or SHIFT keys)
- Preview
  - Small animation preview window in the top right corner
  - Full screen mode
- Frames
  - Ability to add/delete a frame
  - Ability to reorder a frame via Drag and Drop
  - Ability to duplicate a frame
- Please use `Frames` and `Preview` components of https://www.piskelapp.com/ as an ideal example of what should be done.
- Export the final result
  - to local file system in any format (.gif / .apng)
- User session
  - Current session should be saved and be accessible when user opens up the page again.
- Landing page. This page should include the following information:
  - Screenshots
  - Animation examples
  - Implemented functionality overview
  - Link to the editor itself
  - Information about the author
- Keyboard shortcuts
  - All actions should be available via keyboard shortcuts
    - tools
    - export
    - add / delete / create frame
  - Keyboard shortcuts should be available on hover
  - Modal window to change keyboard shortcuts

## Technical requirements:

1. Browser support: latest version of Google **Chrome**.
2. Usage of **JS/ES2015+** or **TypeScript**.
3. You can use libraries and frameworks like React / Angular / Vue / jQuery / Bootstrap / Lodash / wrapper for file formats / API utilisation.
4. Final version of the editor should be **available via a link**. The easiest way to do so is to host your project on GitHub pages / Google Firebase / Heroku / Netlify / any other hosting.
5. Usage of Jest / any other tool for writing tests. You also need to setup test coverage output in the package.json by 'npm run coverage'. Your tests need cover the following code:
   1. Utilities, pure functions
   2. UI components
   3. Tools functionality (i.e. adding pixels, changing pixels, adding rectangle / circle)
6. Have to use browser's Canvas API to draw frames.

### Requirements to the commits, PR, repository

- [stage2-tasks-requirements](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/docs/stage2.md)
- worklog of the project

#### Worklog

To show process of development it needs to describe small amount of time and what work was accomplish during that time.

##### Example

You need to provide high level, feature base (what need to score) description.

| Start time | End time | time spent | feature                           |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| May 27     | Jun 6    | 3h         | base structure of the project     |
| Jun 7      | Jun 7    | 12h        | frame management implementation   |
| Jun 7      | Jun 7    | 12h        | preview animation implementation  |
| Jun 8      | Jun 10   | 8h         | keyboard shortcuts implementation |
| Jun 11     | Jun 12   | 5h         | layers implementation             |
| Jun 12     | Jun 12   | 10h        | bug fixing                        |

Total: 50h

### Requirements to the quality of code

- Don't use nested SetTimeout, synchronization of code using timeouts etc. Use promises/async/await where it's possible.
- Don't use magic number instead of named constants.
  For example, instead of
  `if (event.keyCode === 32 || event.keyCode === 13) {….}`
  use
  `if (event.keyCode === KeyboardEvent.SPACE || key === KeyboardEvent.ENTER ) {….}` etc.
- Don't use functions that have more than 40 lines of code (excluding variable declarations).
- Minimal use of ternary operators.
- Use pure functions where it's possible. If you haven't heard this term before, you can start your acquaintance [here](https://medium.com/@jamesjefferyuk/javascript-what-are-pure-functions-4d4d5392d49c) or [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)
- Use meaningful names for variables. Avoid single characters for variable names (i, n, j, d, etc.), abstract or common names (obj, arr, num, item1, etc.)
- Use the eslint with airbnb for all js code

### Project structure. Organization of files and folders (example):

Usage of webpack is mandatory! Components directories should include all the needed resources and styles. For example, by removing folder `modal-dialog` all styles related to this dialog will be removed as well.

    dist
    src
    ├── components
    │   ├── loading
    │   ├── modal-dialog
    │   ├── frames-list
    ├── screens
    │   ├── canvas
    │   │   ├── images
    │   │   ├── index.html       # template
    │   │   ├── index.scss       # styles
    │   │   ├── index.js         # logic
    │   ├── preview
    │   ├── export
    ├── app.js                   # main entry point.
    webpack.config.js
    README.md                    # links to landing page

Notes for Webpack usage:

- There is no point in putting your code inside an Immediately-invoked Function Expression.
- There is no point in applying 'use strict' mode.
