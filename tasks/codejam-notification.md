# CodeJam-DOM User Notifications

### Deadline: Sunday, November 11, 2018 23:59

## Task

Your task is to implement UI component for notifications with the functionality described below. JS and CSS files should be located in the `notifications` folder. As soon as you have implemented one of the features, commit the file. Then you should implement next feature and commit it. You can refactor code and commit changes before deadline.

### Component description

You need to implement the component that appears in the upper right corner of the screen 5 seconds after the page loads. The component displays given "useful information" and saves its position while scrolling the page. The "useful information" must be preset to the component as an array of strings during its initialization.

Component must contain the following elements:

- (1) Closing icon. Click on it closes the component.
- (2) Checkbox that disables notification and sets a flag into local storage. If the flag is set, component won't be shown when the page reloads.
- Arrows (3) and (4) that switch the contents of element (6) to the previous and the next notification respectively.
- (5) Notification number that shows current notification position.
- Keyboard support. Component supports keyboard control: switching back and forward, closing by clicking on the cross.
