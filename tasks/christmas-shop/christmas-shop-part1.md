### Penalties

Penalties for the task are assigned by the course curators, not by students. An imposed penalty results in zero points for the task. If you believe there's a reason to apply any of the following penalties in the work you're evaluating, please direct message the link to it to one of the curators:

1. The layout of the entire design or individual blocks is implemented using images, except in cases where the image is specifically required by the design.
2. The use of frameworks, libraries, and technologies that are prohibited in the [Technical Requirements](./christmas-shop.md#technical-requirements).

## Criteria for Evaluation

**Maximum score for the task: 110 points**

The scoring for each requirement is detailed in the [CrossCheck Criteria](#crosscheck-criteria) section.

Any disputed issues should be resolved in favor of the student being assessed.

## Specifics of Verifying Layout

- A deviation of up to 10px horizontally and vertically from the layout is permissible as long as visual congruity between the design and the markup is preserved.
- Utilize the [PerfectPixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=ru) Chrome extension to verify alignment with the design.
- When using the PerfectPixel extension, ensure it is set to a scale factor of 1, and that your browser and operating system are set to 100% scale.
- If the screen resolution is greater than 1440 pixels, to check for compliance with the layout, it is sufficient to center horizontally the layout or manually align it with the top-left corner guides.
- If the screen resolution is 1440 pixels or less, use the device toolbar in Google Chrome browser in responsive mode for checking.
- Please note that when checking the work in a window with a width of 1440 pixels, the layout may compress by approximately 17 pixels. This happens because part of the layout space is consumed by the vertical scroll (17 pixels - the standard scroll size for Google Chrome).
- Each block and section should be evaluated independently; deficiencies in one block should not affect the assessment of subsequent blocks. Start each new block's review with it aligned to the overlaid layout from PerfectPixel.
- For text, check its alignment and spacing within the confines of the block. Text sizes should be checked only for their height. Variations in word width and letter spacing are not considered errors as long as the correct font with specified properties is used.

## How to Submit

- **Christmas Shop. Part-1 - Fixed Layout** task is evaluated through a cross-check process.
- Upon receipt of the task and prior to the submission deadline, proceed to the RS App at https://app.rs.school/. Navigate to **Cross-Check: Submit**, select the appropriate task from the dropdown list, and enter the URL of your deployed website into the **Solution URL** field. Then click the **Submit** button.

## Submit Recommendations

- Aim to submit early once the submission option becomes available in the RS App. You are free to make additional changes up until the deadline.
- Given that the project is contained within a private repository, there's no need to share repository or pull request links as reviewers will not have access to them. Private repositories are visible only to you, the course administrators, and any assigned mentors.
- Verify that the deployed website link is functional, especially when accessed in the browser's incognito mode.

## Task Evaluation

- Follow the instructions for conducting a cross-check available at: https://rs.school/docs/ru/cross-check-flow
