## Coffee-House. Week-3: Adding Functionality

### Main Task Description and Requirements

- [Detailed Description](coffee-house.md)

In this part of the task, you need to add the following functionality to the web pages previously created in the task:

- Opening and closing **burger menu** on pages when the width is <=768px.
- **Carousel** on the `home` page.
- **Category switching** for products on the `menu` page.
- **Loading more products** by button click if there are more than 4 on the `menu` page.
- **Modal** for the selected product on the `menu` page.

❗ Each DOM object (block) with a product description, whether it's a product in a category or a modal on the 'menu' page, will be generated from data objects with corresponding fields. The assembled JSON with the necessary objects for the project can be found in the [Materials](#materials).

## Materials:

- [The assembled JSON with all products](products.json)
- [Video for `Enjoy` block](https://www.pexels.com/ru-ru/video/2909914/)
- [Design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SAoBmuOqTfguehdT4IFRxQ/Coffee-House?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=qis81E9Ovgx47eVl-0)

## Workflow

1. The task should be completed in private repository of the school. [How to work with a school's private repository](https://docs.rs.school/#/private-repository).
2. Create a new branch named `coffee-house-week3` from `coffee-house` branch. You will find the `coffee-house` folder containing the project files completed in the previous stage within this branch.
3. Continue working on the task within the branch you have created.
4. Ensure your work meets the [CrossCheck Criteria](#crosscheck-criteria).
5. Independently evaluate your work according to the provided [Criteria for Evaluation](#criteria-for-evaluation).
6. Create a Pull Request from the `coffee-house-week3` branch to the `coffee-house` branch, resolve any conflicts that arise, and then marge the Pull Request.  
   The title of the Pull Request can be chosen at your discretion. A description for this Pull Request is not necessary.
7. After completing the cross-check for the previous part of the task, update your project's deployment. For example, yoy can create and merge a Pull Request from the `coffee-house` branch to the `gh-pages` branch.  
   The title of the Pull Request can be chosen at your discretion. A description for this Pull Request is not necessary.
8. Once you have completed your work, update the Pull Request from the `coffee-house` branch to the `main` branch to include the newly added functionality from the second part of the task.  
   It is not required to merge this Pull Request.
9. Submit the deployment link of your project in the "Cross-Check Submit" section of the [RS APP](https://app.rs.school/).
10. After the task deadline has passed, the cross-check phase will start, lasting three days. To earn points for the task, you must review all the projects assigned to you for cross-checking and submit your review results in the "Cross-Check Review" section of the [RS APP](https://app.rs.school/).

## How to Submit

- **Coffee-House. Week-3: Adding Functionality** task is evaluated through a cross-check process.
- Upon receipt of the task and prior to the submission deadline, proceed to the RS App at https://app.rs.school/. Navigate to **Cross-Check: Submit**, select the appropriate task from the dropdown list, and enter the URL of your deployed website into the **Solution URL** field. Then click the **Submit** button.

## Submit Recommendations

- Aim to submit early once the submission option becomes available in the RS App. You are free to make additional changes up until the deadline.
- Given that the project is contained within a private repository, there's no need to share repository or pull request links as reviewers will not have access to them. Private repositories are visible only to you, the course administrators, and any assigned mentors.
- Verify that the deployed website link is functional, especially when accessed in the browser's incognito mode.

## Task Evaluation

- Follow the instructions for conducting a cross-check available at: https://docs.rs.school/#/cross-check-flow
