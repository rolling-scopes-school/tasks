## Description

User can book train tickets simply enter his departure and destination points, select travel date and time, and browse through a list of available trains.

To get from one point to another, user need to find a route between stations as well as the date of a possible trip.

A **station** is a place where a train arrives in a city, like a terminal, which is clearly connected to some other stations. A train can only move between stations that are connected to each other. _There can be only one station in a city._

A **carriage** is a structure for transporting passengers with specific parameters. The type of carriage is configured by:

- the number of rows of passenger seats
- the number of seats to the left of the aisle in a row
- the number of seats to the right of the aisle in a row

A **route** is a set of connected stations that a train travels through with a specific list of carriages. A train can consist of carriages of different types in any order and in any quantity. A route does not have a direct association with travel time.

A **schedule** or **ride** is a precisely defined time for a trainâ€™s journey between first and last stations on the route, indicating the _price for each type of carriage for each segment between stations_, so that passengers can pay only for the trip between the desired stations.

Apart from ride, the **trip** is a journey between selected stations by user. It is part of ride.
