## Wish List Page

The Wishlist page should create an engaging and seamless experience for users by allowing them to view, manage, and modify the products saved in their wishlist. This includes displaying products with essential details, enabling users to remove items from the wishlist, selecting desired quantities and options for each product, and transferring products to the shopping cart. To achieve these goals, utilize APIs such as commercetools or other simple APIs for data management and updates. Moreover, maintain the wishlist data using local storage.

The layout should be visually appealing, displaying products in an organized list or grid format with their corresponding images, titles, prices, and options. The overall design should emphasize user-friendliness and facilitate an effortless browsing experience.

Incorporate various interactive features into the page design to optimize the shopping experience, such as product removal options and the ability to update the local storage of the user's wishlist accordingly. This will ensure users can efficiently view, manage, and modify the products they have saved to their wishlist at their convenience.
