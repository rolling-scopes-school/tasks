### Implement Robust Filtering Options for Product List Using commercetools API (20 points)

#### Description

The application should offer a comprehensive set of filters allowing users to refine the product list based on various product attributes, such as price range, brand, color, size, or other relevant characteristics. The filtering functionality should be implemented using the commercetools API.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Fetching Product Attributes:** Using the commercetools API, fetch the necessary product attributes that will serve as the basis for filters. This might include, but is not limited to, attributes like price, brand, color, and size.
2. **Designing the Filter Interface:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for applying filters. This could be a sidebar, a dropdown menu, or a modal window.
3. **Applying Filters:** Implement functionality that updates the product list based on the selected filters. This will involve making new API requests with filter parameters to the commercetools API.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Filter Options Layout:** Display filter options in a clear and organized manner. You might want to group related filters or use visual elements like sliders for price ranges.
2. **Active Filters Indication:** Clearly indicate which filters are currently applied. This could be done through highlighting, checkboxes, or some other visual cues.
3. **Resetting Filters:** Provide an easy way for users to reset the filters and view the unfiltered product list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- A robust set of filters is available, allowing users to refine the product list based on various attributes like price range, brand, color, size, etc.
- Applying a filter updates the product list to show only products that match the selected filter criteria. This updating should be done using the commercetools API.
- It's clear to the user which filters are currently applied.
- There is a clear and easy way for users to reset the filters.
