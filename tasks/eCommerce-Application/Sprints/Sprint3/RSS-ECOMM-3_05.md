### Implement Search Functionality for Product List Using commercetools API (15 points)

#### Description

The application should have an efficient and user-friendly search feature that allows users to quickly find and display relevant products based on their search query. This search functionality should be implemented using the commercetools API.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Search Input Field:** Provide a text input field where users can type their search queries. This field should be visible and easily accessible on the product list page.
2. **Search Functionality:** Implement a search function that uses the user's input to find and display matching products from the commercetools API. The function should handle different cases (e.g., uppercase, lowercase) and partial matches.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Input Field Design:** The search input field should be visible and accessible. It should be designed in a way that suggests its function (e.g., with a magnifying glass icon).
2. **Search Result Indication:** Display search results in a clear and organized manner. You might want to highlight the matching text in the product name or description.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Users can type search queries into a text input field on the product list page.
- Based on the user's input, matching products are fetched from the commercetools API and displayed on the product list page.
- The search function is case-insensitive and supports partial matches.
