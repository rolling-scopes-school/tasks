### Implement Routing and Browser Navigation for User Profile Page (15 points)

#### Description
To enhance the user experience, implement routing and browser navigation that allows users to navigate to the User Profile page.

#### Implementation Details

1. **User Profile Page:** This page should display information about a user's profile.
2. **Routing:** The URL in the browser should change when users navigate to the User Profile page and when they navigate away from it. The User Profile page should have a unique URL that can be directly accessed.
3. **Browser Navigation:** Ensure the proper functioning of the browser's navigation buttons (Back and Forward) when navigating to and from the User Profile page.
