### Implement Category and Breadcrumb Navigation (25 points)

#### Description

Our goal is to make the product exploration process easy and efficient. We need to implement clear and user-friendly navigation that enables users to explore and switch between different product categories or subcategories. In addition, we need to provide breadcrumb navigation to help users understand their current location within the category hierarchy.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Category Display:** The navigation options should be prominently displayed, possibly as a side panel or a drop-down menu. This might vary depending on the chosen design.
2. **API Usage:** Make use of the commercetools API, or any other simple API, to fetch the categories/subcategories information. The API call should return a list of all available categories/subcategories.
3. **Navigation Implementation:** Each category or subcategory should be clickable, and when clicked, the product list should be updated to reflect the selected category or subcategory.
4. **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Breadcrumb navigation should be present on all category pages to give users a clear understanding of the category hierarchy and their current location within it. Each segment of the breadcrumb should be a clickable link that takes the user to the corresponding category or subcategory page.
5. **Category Hierarchy:** Ensure that the category hierarchy is accurately reflected in the breadcrumb navigation. This will likely involve fetching category data from the chosen API (commercetools or another simple API) and dynamically generating the breadcrumb links based on this data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- User-friendly navigation for product categories and subcategories is implemented and clearly visible.
- Users can switch between different product categories and subcategories.
- Clicking on a category or subcategory updates the product list accordingly.
- Breadcrumb navigation or a similar navigational aid is present on all category pages, accurately reflecting the category hierarchy and the user's current location within it.
- Clicking on a segment of the breadcrumb navigation takes the user to the corresponding category or subcategory page.
