### RSS-ECOMM-67: Implement User Profile Navigation in Header (5 points)

#### Description
In order to provide users with easy access to their Profile page, a User Profile link or button should be added to the header of the site. This navigation option should be accessible to all logged-in users.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Navigation Option:** Add a User Profile link or button to the header that directs users to their Profile page. This could be a text link, an icon, or a combination of both.
2. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the User Profile link or button is visible and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.
3. **Routing:** Implement routing from the User Profile link or button to the User Profile page. This may involve working with your chosen front-end framework's routing library (e.g., React Router for React.js).

#### Visual Implementation Ideas
1. **Visual Cues:** The User Profile link or button should have some visual indication (like underlining or color change) when hovered or clicked to provide feedback to the user.
2. **Iconography:** If using an icon, choose or design one that clearly signifies the User Profile page.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- A User Profile link or button is present in the website's header.
- Clicking on the User Profile link or button redirects the user to their Profile page.
