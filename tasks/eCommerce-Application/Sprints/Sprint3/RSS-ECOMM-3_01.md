### 🚀 Issue RSS-ECOMM-3_01: Fetch and Display Product List using Commercetools API (25 points) 🎯

#### 🖊️ Description

The application should utilize the commercetools API 🗂️ to fetch a list of products 📦 with essential details such as the product name 🏷️, image 🖼️, and description 📝. The data fetched from the API should be parsed and organized to be displayed on the Catalog Product page 📄, where users can view the list 📋 and select individual products for more detailed information.

#### 🔧 Implementation Details

1. **API Setup:** Set up the commercetools API in your project, following the guidelines provided in the API documentation 📘. Ensure you have the necessary credentials 🔐 and permissions to fetch product data.
2. **Fetching Data:** Use the appropriate commercetools API endpoints to fetch product data. The `GET /{projectKey}/products` endpoint could be useful for this task. Remember to handle potential errors in data fetching, like network errors 🌐 or API limitations ⛔.
3. **Data Parsing and Display:** Parse the fetched data to extract the necessary product details: name, image, and description. Display this data on the Catalog Product page in a user-friendly format 🙋‍♂️.

#### 💡 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Product cards:** Display each product on the Catalog Product page in a card-like format 🎴, with the product image, name, and brief description visible.
2. **Product image:** The product image should be clear and accurately represent the product.
3. **Product name and description:** The product name should be in a larger, bold font to quickly draw the user's attention 👁️. The product description should be brief, informative, and provide necessary details to understand the product at a glance.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
