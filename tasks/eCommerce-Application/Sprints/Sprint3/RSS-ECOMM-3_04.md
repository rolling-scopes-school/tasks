### 🎯 Issue RSS-ECOMM-3_04: Implement Sorting Functionality for Product List Using commercetools API (15 points)

#### 📋 Description

The application should offer users the ability to sort 🔢 the product list by various properties, such as price (ascending ↗️, descending ↘️) and name (alphabetically 🆎). This sorting functionality should be implemented using the commercetools API.

#### 🔨 Implementation Details

1. **Designing the Sorting Interface:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for sorting. This could be a dropdown menu with different sorting options.
2. **Sorting Functionality:** Implement functionality that updates the product list based on the selected sorting option. This will involve making new API requests with sorting parameters to the commercetools API.

#### 🎨 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Sorting Options Layout:** Display sorting options in a clear and easily accessible manner. You could use a dropdown menu with labels clearly describing the sorting method.
2. **Active Sorting Indication:** Clearly indicate the currently selected sorting method. This could be done by highlighting the selected sorting option in the dropdown menu.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Users can sort the product list by price (ascending, descending) and name (alphabetically).
- Applying a sorting option updates the product list to reflect the chosen sorting method. This updating should be done using the commercetools API.
- The currently active sorting method is clearly indicated to the user.
