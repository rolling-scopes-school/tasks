### Implement Sorting Functionality for Product List Using commercetools API (15 points)

#### Description

The application should offer users the ability to sort the product list by various properties, such as price (ascending, descending) and name (alphabetically). This sorting functionality should be implemented using the commercetools API.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Designing the Sorting Interface:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for sorting. This could be a dropdown menu with different sorting options.
2. **Sorting Functionality:** Implement functionality that updates the product list based on the selected sorting option. This will involve making new API requests with sorting parameters to the commercetools API.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Sorting Options Layout:** Display sorting options in a clear and easily accessible manner. You could use a dropdown menu with labels clearly describing the sorting method.
2. **Active Sorting Indication:** Clearly indicate the currently selected sorting method. This could be done by highlighting the selected sorting option in the dropdown menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Users can sort the product list by price (ascending, descending) and name (alphabetically).
- Applying a sorting option updates the product list to reflect the chosen sorting method. This updating should be done using the commercetools API.
- The currently active sorting method is clearly indicated to the user.
