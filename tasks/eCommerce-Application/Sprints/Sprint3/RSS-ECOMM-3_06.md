### Interactive Product Cards (10 points)

#### Description

Product cards displayed on the product list page should change their appearance when the user hovers over them. This will enhance the browsing experience by providing visual feedback and making the interface more dynamic.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Product Card Design:** The product card should display key details about the product (such as name, image, and price). It should be aesthetically pleasing and match the overall design theme of the website.
2. **Hover Effect:** When the user hovers over a product card, its appearance should change in a way that indicates it is being interacted with. This could be accomplished with changes in color, shadow, scale, or other visual properties.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Color Change:** Alter the background color of the product card on hover.
2. **Shadow Effect:** Add or increase a shadow effect to give the impression that the card is being lifted off the page.
3. **Scale Transformation:** Slightly increase the size of the product card to draw attention to it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Product cards on the product list page display key product details.
- When a user hovers over a product card, its appearance changes to indicate it is being interacted with.
