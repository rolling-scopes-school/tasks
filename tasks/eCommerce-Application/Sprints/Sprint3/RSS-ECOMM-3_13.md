### 🎯 Issue RSS-ECOMM-3_13: Implement Image Slider in Enlarged Image Modal (15 points)

#### 📋 Description

The enlarged image modal should not only display a single product image 🖼️, but should also include a slider feature, enabling users to navigate through all product images fetched from the chosen API. This allows users to view all images of a product without having to close the modal.

#### 🔨 Implementation Details

1. **Slider Setup:** Implement a slider within the enlarged image modal. This could be a custom-built slider or one from a library or framework. The slider should display one image at a time and have navigational controls to cycle through the images.
2. **Image Fetching:** Fetch all product images from the chosen API and include them in the slider. Ensure that these images are appropriately sized and formatted for the slider.
3. **Navigation Controls:** Implement controls (like arrows or dots) to allow users to navigate through the images in the slider. These controls should be easily visible and intuitive to use.

#### 🎨 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Slider Design:** The slider should be clean and straightforward, focusing attention on the images themselves. Avoid unnecessary decorations or elements that might distract from the product images.
2. **Navigation Controls:** The navigation controls should be designed in a way that they do not obscure the images but are still easily accessible for the user.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The enlarged image modal includes a slider that displays all product images fetched from the API.
- Users can navigate through the images using the slider controls.
