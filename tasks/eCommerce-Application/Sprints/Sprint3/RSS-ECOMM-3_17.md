### ðŸŽ¯ Issue RSS-ECOMM-3_17: Implement Password Change in User Profile Page (15 points)

#### ðŸ“‹ Description

2. **Form Validation:** Ensure the updated password meets the necessary criteria (minimum length, complexity, etc.).
3. **Current Password Verification:** Confirm the user's current password before applying the change.
4. **Saving Changes:** Provide a mechanism to save changes made in the password change mode, ideally with a clear indication (such as a button) that signifies saving changes.
5. **Backend Integration:** Implement the password change by integrating with the commercetools platform, following the appropriate API guidelines.
6. **Re-authentication:** Trigger re-authentication if needed, according to the authentication/authentication flow requirements for commercetools applications.

#### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Change Password Button/Link:** Add a visible "Change Password" ðŸ”‘ button or link within the user profile page or settings, indicating that the password can be changed independently.
2. **Password Change Modal or Page:** Display a modal or navigate to a separate page when the "Change Password" option is selected, showing required input fields (current password, new password, confirm new password).
3. **Save and Cancel Buttons:** Display "Save" and "Cancel" buttons on the password change screen, making it clear how users can save or discard changes.

#### âœ… Acceptance Criteria
