### 🎯 Issue RSS-ECOMM-3_14: Present User's Personal Information on User Profile Page (10 points)

#### 📋 Description

The User Profile page should display the user's personal information 📝. This is an essential feature that allows users to view and verify their personal details. It also enhances the personalization aspect of the user experience.

#### 🔨 Implementation Details

1. **User Information:** Display the user's first name, last name, and date of birth 📅 on the User Profile page.
2. **User Addresses:** List all of the user's saved addresses 🏠 on the User Profile page. Each address entry should display all relevant information (street, city, state, zip code, country). Also, clearly indicate which address is set as the default billing address and which one is the default shipping address. Use appropriate labels or markers to distinguish them.

#### 🎨 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **User Info Layout:** You might want to divide the User Profile page into different sections for clarity. For example, one section could be dedicated to personal information (name, date of birth), while another could list user addresses.
2. **Highlighting Default Addresses:** Clearly differentiate the default shipping and billing addresses from the rest. This could be achieved by using different background colors, adding a label, or placing these addresses at the top of the list.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The User Profile page displays the user's first name, last name, and date of birth.
- The User Profile page lists all saved addresses for the user, with all relevant information for each address.
- The default billing and shipping addresses are clearly indicated on the User Profile page.
