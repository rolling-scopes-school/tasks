## Sprint 1: Repository Setup, Project Management, CommerceTools Integration, and Development Environment Configuration (145 points)

In the first sprint, the team will focus on setting up the project repository, establishing effective project management using a task board, integrating with CommerceTools to create the project and API client, and configuring the development environment with a bundler, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Jest for testing. The mentor will evaluate the team's progress and assign points based on achieving specific goals and milestones.

### Working with the Repository

- Create a `develop` branch from the `main` or `master` branch.
- For each task, create a new branch from the `develop` branch, make the changes, and create a pull request to merge the changes back into the `develop` branch after a code review. Multiple issues can be combined into a single pull request.
- At the end of the sprint, create a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `main` or `master` branch with a description in accordance with the requirements of rs-school.
- Share the pull request link with the mentor for review and evaluation.
