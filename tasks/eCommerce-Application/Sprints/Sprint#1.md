## Sprint 1: Repository Setup, Project Management, CommerceTools Integration, and Development Environment Configuration (150 points) 😊

In the first sprint, the team will focus on setting up the project repository, establishing effective project management using a task board, integrating with CommerceTools to create the project and API client, and configuring the development environment with a bundler, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Jest for testing. 😎 The mentor will evaluate the team's progress and assign points based on achieving specific goals and milestones.

### Working with the Repository 📁

- Create a `develop` branch from the `main` or `master` branch.
- For each task, create a new branch from the `develop` branch, make the changes, and create a pull request to merge the changes back into the `develop` branch after a code review. Multiple issues can be combined into a single pull request. 🔄
- At the end of the sprint, create a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `main` or `master` branch with a description in accordance with the requirements of rs-school. 🎓
- Share the pull request link with the mentor for review and evaluation. 👀
