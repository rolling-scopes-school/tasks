## 🎯 Sprint 2: Login, Registration, and Main Pages Implementation

In the second sprint, the team will focus on implementing the login, registration and main pages, including input validation, integration with an authentication service, managing user authentication state, saving the authentication token, providing buttons to navigate between the login and registration pages, and implementing routing for proper navigation. The team's progress will be evaluated through a cross-check process, where other students will assign points based on achieving specific goals and milestones. The mentor will also evaluate the team's progress using separate evaluation criteria.
