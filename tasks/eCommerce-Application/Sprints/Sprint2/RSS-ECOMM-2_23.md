### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_23: Logout Functionality for Authorized Users 👤🔚 (5 points)

#### Description 📜

Add logout functionality for authorized users. Upon logging out, users should be redirected to the login or main page, which provides them the option to log in or register anew.

#### Acceptance Criteria ✅

- An option to log out 🚪 is available for authorized users.
- Upon logging out, users are redirected to the login or main page. 🔀
- After logging out, users have the option to log in or register again. 🔁

Let's make the log-out experience as smooth as possible, because remember, even if the user logs out, it's not "The End of the Road." Like Boyz II Men said, we can "Let go, let go, let go, let go...it's unnatural" but we know they will return to our application again! 🎵🎤
