### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_13: Redirect users to the main page upon successful account creation and automatic login (15 points) 🚀

#### Description

Redirect users to the application's main page, displaying personalized content, upon successful account creation and automatic login. Ensure a smooth transition and handle redirection in a way that accounts for browser history, so users can utilize the back and forward navigation buttons seamlessly. 🔄🔙🔜

To implement the redirection process, consider the following recommendations:

- Use the routing or navigation functionality provided by the front-end framework or libraries of your choice. 🧭
- If you are not using a front-end framework, refer to these resources for redirection in plain TypeScript:
  - [window.location documentation - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location) to understand how to use the `window.location` API for navigation. 🌐
  - [History API documentation - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) to learn about the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods for managing browser history. 📜
- Ensure that the user's authentication state is updated and properly maintained throughout the application so that they can access personalized content when redirected to the main page. 🔐
- Merely hiding the registration form and showing the main page is not enough; make sure that the user is redirected to a new page or route. 🚦
- Utilize client-side routing techniques to minimize loading time and provide a more seamless user experience. ⏱️

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Users are redirected to the main page upon successful account creation and automatic login 🎯
- The redirection process takes into account browser history for seamless navigation ⏳
- Proper use of the chosen front-end framework or library for handling routing and navigation, or implementation of plain TypeScript solutions when not using a front-end framework 🛠️

And remember, in the immortal words of Imagine Dragons, "I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust, I'm breathing in the chemicals" - let's make this redirect as exhilarating as breathing in new life! 🐉🎸
