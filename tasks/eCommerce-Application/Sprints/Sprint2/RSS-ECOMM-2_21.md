### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_21: Navigation to Login and Registration Pages for Unauthorized Users (15 points) 🔒🔑

#### Description

Enable easy navigation for unauthorized users between the login and registration pages. The links or buttons for these pages should be clear, visible, and accessible, following best practices for user interface design. 🖥️🖱️

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Text links**: Display the links for "Login" and "Register" as underlined text in a suitable place, ensuring good contrast against the background for easy visibility. 📝
2. **Styled buttons**: Create button elements with consistent background color, hover effect, and typography for the "Login" and "Register" links, making them visually distinct from other elements. 🖌️
3. **Icons with labels**: Use recognizable icons (e.g., a key icon for Login and a plus icon for Register) accompanied by labels for each link. Make sure the icon and text are visually connected and have a consistent style. 🗝️➕

Let's take a leaf out of Imagine Dragons' book and aim to make our users feel like they're "On Top of the World" with intuitive and easy navigation. As the song goes, "I've been waiting to smile, been holding it in for a while, Take it with me if I can, Been dreaming of this since a child. I'm on top of the world." 🎵🌍
