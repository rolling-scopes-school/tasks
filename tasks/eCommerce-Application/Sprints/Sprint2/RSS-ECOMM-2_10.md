### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_10: Display clear error messages for invalid inputs in the registration form (20 points) ‚õîÔ∏è

#### Description

Display clear and user-friendly error messages indicating any validation issues, such as an improperly formatted email address, a weak password, or incomplete address information. Make sure that error messages are shown next to the corresponding input fields and have an accessible design for users.

UI suggestions for highlighting errors (not all methods are required; you can choose the most suitable ones for your design):

- Use colors to indicate errors: Display error messages in a contrasting color, such as red, to make them easily visible and distinguishable from the input text.
- Icon indicators: Show an error or warning icon next to the input field with the validation issue.
- Border styling: Change the border color or style of the input field to signify a validation error.
- Tooltips or popovers: Show tooltips or popovers on hovering or focusing the input field with validation issues that provide more details on the error.

#### Acceptance Criteria üö¶

- Error messages are displayed for each invalid input in the registration form
- Error messages are clear, concise, and visually accessible
- Selected UI elements are used effectively to highlight validation errors and improve user experience

And as AC/DC would put it: "I hit the sack, I've been too long I'm glad to be back." Well, we're not glad to see errors come back, so let's stop them in their tracks! üé∏ü§ò
