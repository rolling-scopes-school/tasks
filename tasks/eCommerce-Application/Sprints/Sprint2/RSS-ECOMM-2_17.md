### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_17: Add links to all functional pages on the main page (5 points)

#### Description

In order to make navigation easier for users, add links to all functional pages of the application on the main page. These links should include, but not be limited to, the login and registration pages.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

- Position the links in a visible and accessible place on the main page. They could be placed in a top navigation bar or in a sidebar, depending on the layout of the application.
- Consider using descriptive labels for the links to help users understand where each link will take them. For instance, "Login" for the login page and "Register" for the registration page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Links to all functional pages of the application are present on the main page, including the login and registration pages.
- The links are clearly visible and accessible to users, making the navigation easy and intuitive.
