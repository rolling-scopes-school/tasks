### Integrate the registration form with a chosen authentication service (10 points)

#### Description

Integrate the registration form with a chosen authentication service, such as commercetools, to handle user registration. Ensure that the registration process is secure and follows best practices for handling user information. In the case of commercetools, you can refer to their API documentation for customer registration here: [commercetools API - Create/Sign up Customer](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/customers#create-sign-up-customer).

Upon successful account creation, display a success message to the user, informing them that their account has been created. The message should be clear, concise, and visually accessible.

You can check the successful creation of a customer using the browser's DevTools Network tab. When a customer is successfully created, you will see a response like the one documented here: [Customer Created Message](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/messages#ctp:api:type:CustomerCreatedMessage).

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Successful user registration with the chosen authentication service
- Proper submission of user information to the authentication service backend
- A success message is displayed to the user upon successful account creation
- Verification of successful customer creation using the browser's DevTools Network tab
