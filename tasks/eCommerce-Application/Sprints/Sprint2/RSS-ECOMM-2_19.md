### Implement Direct Navigation Links to Main, Login, and Registration Pages for Unauthorized Users (10 points)

#### Description

Implement direct navigation for unauthorized users to the main, login, and registration pages. This means that users should be able to access these pages directly by typing the respective URLs into the address bar of their web browser, without needing to navigate through other pages of the application first. Ensure these direct access links are working properly and take users to the correct pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Users can directly access the main page by typing its URL into the browser's address bar.
- Users can directly access the login page by typing its URL into the browser's address bar.
- Users can directly access the registration page by typing its URL into the browser's address bar.
- Direct access to these pages does not cause any errors or issues with the application's functionality.
- Navigation using the implemented routing is smooth, without page refreshes (when applicable, e.g., in a Single Page Application).
- Navigational features of the browser (such as the back and forward buttons) work correctly after using these direct access links.
