### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_09: Implement client-side validation for required fields in the registration form (25 points) 🔒

#### Description

Implement client-side validation for all required fields in the registration form using JavaScript or a front-end library. The fields include:

- Email: A properly formatted email address (e.g., example@email.com)
- Password: Minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 number
- First name: Must contain at least one character and no special characters or numbers
- Last name: Must contain at least one character and no special characters or numbers
- Date of birth: A valid date input ensuring the user is above a certain age (e.g., 13 years old or older)
- Address fields:
  - Street: Must contain at least one character
  - City: Must contain at least one character and no special characters or numbers
  - Postal code: Must follow the format for the country (e.g., 12345 or A1B 2C3 for the U.S. and Canada, respectively)
  - Country: Must be a valid country from a predefined list or autocomplete field

Ensure that the chosen validation approach is compatible with CommerceTools or the chosen platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria ✔️

- Each required field in the registration form has validation rules
- Registration form submission is prevented if the input doesn't meet the requirements

As Queen sang, "We are the champions, my friends," and with our robust validation rules, we'll keep on fighting 'til the end of invalid form submissions! 🎶🏆
