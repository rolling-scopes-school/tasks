### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_02: Display clear error messages for validation issues (20 points) ðŸš¨

#### Description

Display clear error messages on the login form when validation issues are detected, such as an improperly formatted email address ðŸ“§ or a weak password ðŸ”‘. The error messages should follow specific display rules for a consistent and user-friendly experience.

#### Display Rules for Validation Error Messages ðŸ“š

- Error messages should appear next to the corresponding input field (e.g., either to the right, left, top, or bottom of the input field).
- Error messages should be styled consistently (e.g., with a specific font, color, and size) across all input fields.
- Error messages should not overlap other UI elements or obstruct any important information.
- Error messages should disappear once the user corrects the invalid input and meets the validation criteria.
- Error messages should be easily readable and visually distinct from other text on the page (e.g., by using a different color or font weight).

#### Acceptance Criteria âœ…

- Clear error messages are shown next to the corresponding input field when validation fails.
- Error messages are descriptive, explaining the specific validation issue.
- Error messages follow the specified display rules for a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- Error messages disappear when the user corrects the invalid input.

So team, let's take a leaf from Pink Floyd's book and remember - "All in all, it's just another brick in the wall." And every error message we solve is one less brick in our user's wall! Let's bring the wall down together! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ§±
