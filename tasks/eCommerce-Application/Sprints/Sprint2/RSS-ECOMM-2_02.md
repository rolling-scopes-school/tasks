### Display clear error messages for validation issues (5 points)

#### Description
Display clear error messages on the login form when validation issues are detected, such as an improperly formatted email address or a weak password. The error messages should follow specific display rules for a consistent and user-friendly experience.

#### Display Rules for Validation Error Messages
- Error messages should appear next to the corresponding input field (e.g., either to the right, left, top, or bottom of the input field).
- Error messages should be styled consistently (e.g., with a specific font, color, and size) across all input fields.
- Error messages should not overlap other UI elements or obstruct any important information.
- Error messages should disappear once the user corrects the invalid input and meets the validation criteria.
- Error messages should be easily readable and visually distinct from other text on the page (e.g., by using a different color or font weight).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Clear error messages are shown next to the corresponding input field when validation fails.
- Error messages are descriptive, explaining the specific validation issue.
- Error messages follow the specified display rules for a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- Error messages disappear when the user corrects the invalid input.
