### Issue RSS-ECOMM-2_07: Handle Authentication Token (10 points) 🎫

#### Description

Obtain the authentication token securely after a successful login attempt by sending a request to the token endpoint (e.g., https://auth.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/oauth/project_key/customers/token), allowing for seamless user authentication across the application, but do not save it.

#### Acceptance Criteria ✔️

- The authentication token is obtained from the token endpoint after a successful login attempt.
- The token is used for subsequent requests that require authentication.

Remember the wisdom of the classic Queen track, "I want to break free!" When it comes to our authentication token, we break free from the norm. We don't save it - we're rebels with a cause! 🎵🤘
