## Sprint 4: Basket Page, Catalog Page Enhancements, and About Us Page Implementation 🚀

In this sprint, the team will concentrate on enhancing the Detailed Product Page 📝🔍, building the Basket page 🛒🛠️, and further enhancing the Catalog page 📚🌟. These enhancements will include features such as a comprehensive view of a product 🕶️🔍 with the option to add 📥 or remove 📤 the product from the cart, increase ⬆️ or decrease ⬇️ the quantity of the product, and display a clear indicator 🚦 if the product is already in the user's shopping cart 🛒.

The team will also work on features for the Basket page 🛒📋 like displaying a list of items 📝📦 added to the basket, increasing ⬆️ or decreasing ⬇️ the quantity of each item, removing items ❌ from the basket, displaying the subtotal 💵 and total prices 💰, and a button 🖲️ for proceeding to the checkout page 💳.

For the Catalog page 📚🌟, we will implement interactive product cards 🖼️👆 and shopping cart integration 🛒➕. All these features should be built using the commercetools API 🛠️🌐 for data retrieval and management. We will also implement performance optimization techniques 🚀💡 such as lazy loading ⏳, pagination 📄🔍, or infinite scroll 🔄 to handle a large number of products efficiently 📈.

### 🔧 Working with the Repository
