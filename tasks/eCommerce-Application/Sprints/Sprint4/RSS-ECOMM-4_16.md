### Implement Promo Code Application Feature (10 points)

#### Description

For an engaging and user-friendly shopping experience, develop a feature that enables users to apply promo codes to their orders. The application of these promo codes should offer discounts on eligible items and appropriately adjust the total cost of the cart using the commercetools API. Information about active promo codes should be presented on the main page.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Promo Code Display:** Present active promo codes on the main page to increase visibility and encourage their use.
2. **Promo Code Input Field:** Include a field where users can input their promo codes. This could be a text box, for instance.
3. **Apply Button:** Add an 'Apply' button next to the promo code input field. When a user clicks on this button after entering their promo code, the discount associated with the promo code should be applied to eligible items in the cart.
4. **API Integration:** Connect the promo code application feature to the commercetools API to ensure the total cost of the cart is updated correctly when a promo code is applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- The main page displays active promo codes.
- The cart includes an input field for promo codes and an 'Apply' button.
- When a valid promo code is entered and the 'Apply' button is clicked, the total cost of the cart is updated to reflect the discount associated with the promo code.
- The total cost of the cart, including any discounts from promo codes, is calculated and displayed correctly.
