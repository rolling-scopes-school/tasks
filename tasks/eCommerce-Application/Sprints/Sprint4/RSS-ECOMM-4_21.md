### Implement Routing and Browser Navigation to Basket Page (10 points)

#### Description

Implement routing to allow seamless navigation to the Basket page from all other pages. The Basket page should be accessible whether the user is logged in or not and should support browser navigation buttons (forward and back).

#### Implementation Details

1. **Basket Page:** This page should display the items currently in the user's basket. It should be accessible from all other pages in the application.
2. **Routing:** The URL in the browser should change when users navigate to the Basket page. The Basket page should have a unique URL that can be directly accessed.
3. **Browser Navigation Buttons:** Implement support for browser navigation buttons. If a user navigates to a different page, the back button should take the user to the previously viewed page. The forward button should work correspondingly after using the back button.
4. **Public Accessibility:** The Basket page should be accessible whether the user is logged in or not. This page should not require authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Clicking on a navigation element directing to the Basket page takes the user to the Basket page.
- Navigating to the Basket page changes the URL in the browser.
- The Basket page has a unique URL that can be directly accessed.
- Directly accessing the Basket page's unique URL leads to the Basket page.
- The browser's back and forward buttons work as expected, enabling the user to navigate through their history of visited pages.
- The Basket page is accessible regardless of the user's authentication state.
