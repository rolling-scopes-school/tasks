### Implement Product Quantity Selection Before Adding to Cart (10 points)

#### Description

In order to give users more control over their shopping experience, implement a feature that allows users to select the desired quantity of a product before adding it to their shopping cart.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Quantity Selection:** Provide a way for users to specify the quantity of a product they want to add to their shopping cart. This could be a dropdown menu, a text input field, or another user interface element.

2. **Add to Cart with Quantity:** When a user clicks the "Add to Cart" button, the specified quantity of the product should be added to their shopping cart.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Dropdown Menu:** If the quantity of available product is limited, a dropdown menu may be an appropriate choice for quantity selection. The dropdown menu could list numbers up to the available quantity.
2. **Text Input Field:** If the quantity of available product is substantial or unlimited, a text input field may be more appropriate. Users could type in the desired quantity.
3. **Increment/Decrement Buttons:** Another option could be to use a numerical input with increment and decrement buttons. This would allow users to easily increase or decrease the quantity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Users are able to specify the quantity of a product before adding it to their shopping cart.
- Clicking the "Add to Cart" button adds the specified quantity of the product to the user's shopping cart.
