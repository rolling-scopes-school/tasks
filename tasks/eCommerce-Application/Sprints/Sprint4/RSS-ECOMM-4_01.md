### Add "Add to Cart" Button on Product Cards (10 points)

#### Description

To streamline the user's shopping experience, include an "Add to Cart" button on each product card. This button doesn't have to perform any action at this stage. Its purpose is to provide a user interface that matches common e-commerce practices. If the product is already in the shopping cart, the "Add to Cart" button should be disabled.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Add to Cart Button:** Incorporate an "Add to Cart" button on each product card. This button should be clearly visible and intuitively placed to encourage users to add items to their cart. The button could be a traditional button with a label or an icon that represents adding an item to the cart.

#### Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Icon Use:** Consider using an icon for the "Add to Cart" button, such as a shopping cart or a plus sign. Icons can help users quickly understand the button's function and save space on the product card.
2. **Color Contrast:** If you choose to use a traditional button with a label, consider using a contrasting color to make it stand out on the product card.
3. **Button Position:** Place the "Add to Cart" button in a prominent position on the product card, such as below the product image or next to the product description.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Each product card has an "Add to Cart" button, which can be a traditional button or an icon.
- If the product is already in the shopping cart, the "Add to Cart" button is inactive or provides a relevant notice.
