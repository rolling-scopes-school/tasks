### 🛒 Issue RSS-ECOMM-4_01: Add "Add to Cart" Button on Product Cards (10 points)

#### 📝 Description

To streamline the user's 🛍️ shopping experience, include an "Add to Cart" 🛒 button on each product card. This button doesn't have to perform any action at this stage. Its purpose is to provide a user interface that matches common e-commerce practices. If the product is already in the shopping cart, the "Add to Cart" button should be disabled.

#### 🔨 Implementation Details

1. **Add to Cart Button:** Incorporate an "Add to Cart" 🛒 button on each product card. This button should be clearly visible and intuitively placed to encourage users to add items to their cart. The button could be a traditional button with a label or an icon that represents adding an item to the cart.

#### 🎨 Visual Implementation Ideas

1. **Icon Use:** Consider using an icon for the "Add to Cart" 🛒 button, such as a shopping cart or a ➕ plus sign. Icons can help users quickly understand the button's function and save space on the product card.
2. **Color Contrast:** If you choose to use a traditional button with a label, consider using a contrasting color to make it stand out on the product card.
3. **Button Position:** Place the "Add to Cart" button in a prominent position on the product card, such as below the product image or next to the product description.

#### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Each product card has an "Add to Cart" 🛒 button, which can be a traditional button or an icon.
- If the product is already in the shopping cart, the "Add to Cart" button is inactive or provides a relevant notice.
