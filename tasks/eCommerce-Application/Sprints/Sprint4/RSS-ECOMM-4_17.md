### 💵💰 Issue RSS-ECOMM-4_17: Display Original and Discounted Prices After Promo Code Application (5 points)

#### 📝📚 Description

When a promo code is applied 💸, the system should clearly display both the original 💵 and discounted prices 💰 to the user. This feature improves user experience by explicitly showing the savings achieved by using the promo code 💼. The two prices must be visually distinct 👀 to avoid confusion 🚫.

#### 💻🔧 Implementation Details

1. **Original Price 💵:** Display the original total price before the promo code was applied. This price can be crossed out ❌ or dimmed to indicate that it's not the current total.
2. **Discounted Price 💰:** Display the new total after the promo code is applied. This price should be more prominent than the original price to make it clear that it's the current total 🌟.
3. **Visual Distinction 🌈:** Use color, font size, or other visual cues to distinguish between the original and discounted prices 🎨.

#### ✅🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- Both the original price 💵 and the discounted price 💰 are displayed when a promo code is applied 💸.
- The two prices are visually distinct 👀.
