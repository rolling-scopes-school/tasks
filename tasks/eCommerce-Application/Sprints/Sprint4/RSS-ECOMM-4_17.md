### Display Original and Discounted Prices After Promo Code Application (5 points)

#### Description

When a promo code is applied, the system should clearly display both the original and discounted prices to the user. This feature improves user experience by explicitly showing the savings achieved by using the promo code. The two prices must be visually distinct to avoid confusion.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Original Price:** Display the original total price before the promo code was applied. This price can be crossed out or dimmed to indicate that it's not the current total.

2. **Discounted Price:** Display the new total after the promo code is applied. This price should be more prominent than the original price to make it clear that it's the current total.

3. **Visual Distinction:** Use color, font size, or other visual cues to distinguish between the original and discounted prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Both the original price and the discounted price are displayed when a promo code is applied.
- The two prices are visually distinct.
