### 🧭 Issue RSS-ECOMM-4_22: Implement Routing and Browser Navigation to About Us Page (10 points)

#### 📝👥 Description

Implement routing to facilitate seamless navigation 🧭 to the About Us page from all other pages. The About Us page should be accessible irrespective of the user's login status 👤 and should support browser navigation buttons (forward and back).

#### 💻🔧 Implementation Details

1. **About Us Page 👥:** This page should display information about the team and the project. It should be accessible from all other pages in the application.
2. **Routing 🚏:** The URL in the browser should change when users navigate to the About Us page. The About Us page should have a unique URL that can be directly accessed.
3. **Browser Navigation Buttons ⏪⏩:** Implement support for browser navigation buttons. If a user navigates to a different page, the back button should take the user to the previously viewed page. The forward button should work correspondingly after using the back button.
4. **Public Accessibility 👥:** The About Us page should be accessible whether the user is logged in or not. This page should not require authentication.
