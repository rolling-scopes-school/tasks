### Implement a Basket Icon in Header Navigation (15 points)

#### Description

Implement a basket icon in the header navigation for easy access to the shopping cart. The icon should be clearly visible and serve as a link to the Basket page, allowing users to review the items they've added to their cart.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Basket Icon:** Include a clearly visible basket icon in the header navigation. The icon should be easily identifiable and match the overall design of the website.
