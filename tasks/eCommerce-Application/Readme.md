The application is powered by CommerceTools 🌐, a leading provider of commerce solutions for B2C and B2B enterprises. CommerceTools offers a cloud-native, microservices-based commerce platform that enables brands to create unique and engaging digital commerce experiences.

The application is to be developed in teams of three 👨‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻. Don't forget to register your team on the RS School App via this [link](https://app.rs.school/course/team-distributions?course=js-fe-2023Q1) before you start working on the project.

## Task Submission to Mentor and Cross-Check Rules

1. For the mentor review, each team member will submit their work individually. This means that each member is responsible for demonstrating their individual contributions to the project.

2. For the cross-check review, only the team lead will submit. The team lead will be responsible for consolidating the contributions of the team into a single submission.

## Technology Stack 💻📚

The decision on whether to use a framework for the project lies in the hands of the teams. They have the option to proceed without a framework or, alternatively, they can opt for well-known ones like React ⚛️, Angular 🅰️, or Vue 🟢.

However, there are some constraints on the technology stack:

1. TypeScript is mandatory for this project. It will ensure type safety and improve the maintainability and scalability of the application 📘.
2. jQuery is not allowed. Focus on using modern JavaScript features and APIs, and the capabilities of your chosen framework, rather than relying on jQuery 🚫.
