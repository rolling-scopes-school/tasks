# RSS Gem Puzzle

## Task

You are to implement a classic game — [Gem Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)

### Game rules

`Game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other sizes, particularly the smaller 8-puzzle. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle or 9-puzzle, and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle or 16-puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.`

### Approximate appearance

### Main functional requirements

`Basic (required):`

- the design should be adaptive (or responsive), that includes *desktop(1280px <= width)*, *tablet(768px <= width < 1280px)* and *mobile(320px <= width < 768px)*. When switching between versions everything should be displayed correctly, all functionality should be present, nothing should disappear or leave beyond the screen. It is acceptable to change the appearance for the mobile version (for example, hide the buttons in the burger menu)
- initially, `body` in the index.html file must be empty, all necessary elements are generated using JS
- the default size of the frame is 4x4
- at the beginning state of the game, the frame is filled with randomly generated numbers, when starting a new game, numbers are re-shuffled randomly
- when you click on a tile next to an empty cell, the tile moves to the empty cell

`Advanced:`

- the game can be restarted without reloading the page
- display the game duration in minutes and seconds "##:##" and the number of moves
- implement the functionality to save the game (for example, using localStorage), so that when the page is reloaded, a player can continue from where he left off
- it is possible to turn on / off the sound accompaniment of the movement of tiles
- implement functionality to choose frame size: from 3х3 to 8х8
- the top 10 results are saved in the high score table and can be viewed in any way (for example, by pressing a button)

`additional (to get extra points):`

- tiles can be dragged to an empty cell with the help of mouse
- on a successful game solution, display the message: «Hooray! You solved the puzzle in ##:## and N moves!»
- implement animation moving tiles on the field

Recommended usage of [eslint (eslint-config-airbnb-base)](https://eslint.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (this requirement is not checked)

## Repository requirements

- the work should be done in private school's repository
- source code should be committed to a separate branch
- the **main** (or old style **master**) branch should be empty (contain only files like README.md or .gitignore)
- commit messages should follow the [guideline](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en)
- once the work is finished, create a pull request from a development branch to main (or master)
- the pull request name should contain **the task name**
- the pull request description should contain the following information:
  - link to the task
  - screenshot of your application (one would be enough)
  - link to your application
  - date of completion/deadline
  - your self-check with a preliminary evaluation that is based on the evaluation criteria from the task

## Technical requirements

- the application is checked in the latest version of Google Chrome browser
- jQuery is not allowed
- you can not use Angular / React / Vue
- you can use bootstrap, CSS frameworks, HTML and CSS preprocessors

## Criteria for evaluation:

**Maximum score for the task: 120 points**

### Basic scope +30

- [ ] layout, design, responsive UI: `+10`
- [ ] at the beginning state of the game, the frame is filled with randomly generated and shuffled numbers: `+10`
- [ ] on click on a tile next to an empty cell, the tile moves to the empty cell: `+10`

### Advanced scope +50

- [ ] the game can be restarted without reloading the page: `+10`
- [ ] game duration and number of moves are displayed: `+10`
- [ ] sound accompaniment (on/off) of tiles movement: `+10`
- [ ] implemented saving the state of the game and saving the top 10 results using LocalStorage: `+10`
- [ ] implemented selection of different sizes for frame(from 3x3 to 8x8): `+10`

### Hacker scope +40

- [ ] when the game is finished, the following message is displayed "Hooray! You solved the puzzle in ##:## and N moves!". So that shuffled algorithm should work correctly - user can solve puzzle `+10`
- [ ] animation of tiles' movement on frame: `+15`
- [ ] tiles can be dragged with use of mouse: `+15`
