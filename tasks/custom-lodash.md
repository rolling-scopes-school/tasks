## Custom Lodash

Your task is to implement 'custom' version of the lodash library following next requirements:

1. Usage of `Array.prototype.* or `Object.prototype.\*` is **strictly forbidden**.
2. You can create your own additional service functions (if needed).
3. You may use ES6+ features (any feature which supported by latest stable Chrome).
4. Lodash chain is out of scope
