You can cancel the reservation without any consequences whatsoever by removing your name from the list no later than **24 hours** prior to the presentation **session**. If you have a reasonable excuse not to attend, notify the jury anyway as soon as it is practically possible. You also agree that you must specify your up-to-date contact details and monitor the relevant announcements in the school's channels, otherwise the jury shall be entitled to remove you from the list of presenters without any obligation to notify.

The consequences of the failure to comply with the above rules may result in a penalty of up to **50 points**.

If any time slots become available, students may reserve those for their presentations on a **first-come, first-served** basis.
