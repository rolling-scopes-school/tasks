## Technical requirements

- the application is checked in the latest version of Google Chrome
- use of jQuery is not allowed
- you are not allowed to use Angular / React / Vue
- you are allowed to use bootstrap or any other CSS frameworks
- you are allowed to use HTML and CSS preprocessors
- you decide whether to use a single-page (SPA) or multi-page (MPA) application development approach, as well as the implementation of navigation between pages
  - if you choose a single-page application (SPA) approach, you do not have to implement all the features of this approach (for example, routing) if they are not critical

## Application Design Requirements

- minimum width at which the application is displayed correctly is 320 px
- since the application is intended for kids, including those who aren't able to read, all labels should be accompanied by pictures or icons if possible
- smooth animation, interesting and relevant design, large and user-friendly buttons, colorful icons, beautiful pictures, light, and bright colors are desirable
- all user interface elements in the demo should be present in your application. However, the proposed design is not mandatory and you can make changes to it for improvement purposes

- the design of the final application should look holistic: the look corresponds to user expectations, the pictures for word cards and categories are of good quality and they have the same size and the correct proportions (there are no distortions), all user interface elements function properly, markup does not fall apart when the resolution is changed
- take care of interactivity of clickable elements - hovering the elements changes the appearance of it along with the state of the cursor. Use different styles for active and inactive states of the element
