## Milestone 6. People & Groups

**Score:** 175

The **default page** for authorized user should be the one without extra path (root routing).
Page is split into 2 vertical sections.
Left side is [Group section](#milestone-61-group-list).
Right side is [People section](#milestone-62-people-list).

> [!WARNING]
> Please, do not use any timers or intervals to update Group or People list! Only manual triggers
> are allowed.

## Milestone 6.1. Group list

**Score:** 100

Each of users can observe all available groups to broadcast messages. There is no private groups!
Also, user can create new one that will be visible for all other users.

### Visualization

Left half of the primary page consist of:

**_Update_ button**  
_Update_ button refreshes the group list by sending http-request and renders obtained list.

User can update the list no more than once a minute! Countdown must be present near the _Update_
button till the next update is possible. If time is out countdown disappears.
This state should be preserved even after transition to other pages and back.

> [!NOTE]
> Countdown(timer) and disabled _Update_ button (user cannot click it) is applied only after
> clicking on _Update_ button. First visit on the page should not have any effect on timer.

> [!NOTE]
> Countdown(timer) should display the actual number of seconds remaining until the end of one minute
> after the _Update_ button is pressed, even if the user navigates across pages. That is, if the user
> presses the _Update_ button, goes to other pages, and returns to the list page after 35 seconds, he
> should see the timer showing 25, 24, 23...

**_Create_ button**  
_Create_ button opens modal window with a reactive form where user can enter `name`. Using
endpoint (below) application creates new group and append it into the list **without** retrieving
all group list with http-request again.

Form validation:

- `name` is not more than 30 symbols;
- `name` contains only letters, digits or spaces;

**List of groups**  
Simple list with **clickable items as a link** and extra delete button at the right of the name for
the groups were created by current user.

Clicking on item user is redirected to dedicated page with routing `/group/{:groupID}`

Confirmation modal window appears after clicking on delete group icon. If confirmation was accepted
using http-request the group is deleted and group is being removed from the list **without**
obtaining all group list with http-request again.

_rough example of group list_:  
`---------------------------------`  
`|` Someone's Group name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `|`  
`---------------------------------`  
`|` My Group
name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10006; `|`  
`---------------------------------`  
`|` Someone's Group name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `|`  
`---------------------------------`

### Endpoint

> `GET` https://tasks.app.rs.school/angular/groups/list

User can update the list no more than once a minute! Countdown must be present near the _Update_
button till the next update is possible. If time is out countdown disappears.
