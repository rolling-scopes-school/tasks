# Connections project with real backend

Welcome to the last level of the education journey. We hope this training lesson will enhance and
strengthen your knowledge and skills to design application structure and use entire framework power
solving the issues.

This project is intended for individual performance using the real one-for-all server. You can check
out your colleagues with their progress and be faster and more productive, because everyone should
have the same functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> Application aims to improve your technical skills. You are not limited in appearance, the main
> thing is for all features to be implemented and maximum user-friendly! It means, you have to
> **come up with yours design** of the app!

## General point

Single server provides sharing data and all students can interact with it reading and writing other
data. Each student's frontend project must be **identical in functionality** and any student opening
another student's project should have the same capabilities.

## Limitations

- all users are located in different timezones. Server keeps date and time
  in [UNIX timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format (as number), but you have care about
  appropriate timezone for everyone.
- server does not contain sufficient protection, for learning purpose we cut cumbersome redundant
  processes in order to focus on crucial features. Do not try to break it but inform us if you find
  critical defects.
- all transmitted data is **public** including personal email and messages. Do not use any sensitive
  data.
- server may have restrictions or limitations in data response if DB contains a lot of records. We
  are sincerely asking you to use it only to make sure the application works but do not overuse it
  for fun.

# Angular Application

The initial application can be generated by [`@angular/cli`](https://angular.io/cli/new). Also, we
recommend to use [standalone approach](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components).

You can use additional package with visual components (to simplify and speed up the development):

- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [NGX Bootstrap](https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation)
- [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
- [PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/installation)
- [Taiga UI](https://taiga-ui.dev/getting-started)

You may also need [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store) for production. You are free to utilize any
development packages (
eslint, [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) etc.)
that are installed in `devDependencies` to aid in application construction but usage of any
additional production packages is prohibited!

We encourage you to use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` strategy in components instead
of `Default`.

## Mounting

The source code of your project should be pushed to **school repository** into dedicated
_connections_ folder alongside other projects. As a result application is supposed to be deployed to
any public host-provider to make your project reachable to allow other students check it out.
A link to your working deployed project should be submitted in [RSApp](https://app.rs.school).

All changes have to be merged into primary branch (_main_, _master_) in your repository. There
should be **no any active** branches or merge/pull requests.

In the **README.md** file of your project a brief description should be defined what milestones were
made and the **link** to deployed running version.

## Milestones

Application represents the platform to allow users to communicate via public text messages. Before
starting to use the service a guest must register and sign in, after that all http-requests have to
contain `rs-email`, `rs-uid` and `Authorization` headers.

Authorized user can see vertically divided main page, where left side is a list of public group and
right side is a list of people including personal conversations. Each user can create own public
group and broadcast messages there or use existing group along with other participants.

Personal information can be viewed on a special profile page, where it can be immediately edited.

Detailed information about each part of the application is presented in the sections:

1. [Registration](./milestone_1.registration.md) 60 points
2. [Login](./milestone_2.login.md) 70 points
3. [Profile](./milestone_3.profile.md) 40 points
4. [Update profile](./milestone_4.profile_update.md) 55 points
5. [Logout](./milestone_5.logout.md) 40 points
6. [People and group sections](./milestone_6.people_groups.md) 175 points
7. [Group dialog](./milestone_7.group_dialog.md) 140 points
8. [People conversation](./milestone_8.conversation.md) 140 points
9. [404 page](./milestone_9.404_page.md) 30 points
10. Bonus: [Style theme](./milestone_10.theme.md) 50 points

Total score: **800 points**

## Examination

Each milestone has relative score. Each milestone has number of points for successful result.

> [!WARNING]
> All functionality and all requirements should be met even if user reload(refresh) any page in any
> time!  
> During the cross-check session you can try to refresh any page and validate requirements again.

But in case if some common violation is present the project is losing **additional** points:

#### During Cross-Check

- any uncaught runtime errors: **-100 points** for an error(s) in console.  
  _Explanation_: 400/500 http-error messages could appear in the console, but if it was handled and
  UI displayed some message, notification or made any other communication to the user what is
  happening - that is not the reason to deduct the points from the student.

#### Final conclusion

Restrictions on additional packages cannot be verified by students. This condition will be further
tested for students who score more than half of the points. If a student violates this condition,
the project scores will be nullified.

- used any production npm-package (except NgRx and 1 library with visual
  components): **-800 points**

## Url navigation

#### Guest

Pages available only for users before authorization. That pages are not available for users after
successful authorization and protected by _Guards_.

_`/signup` (registration)_  
Page to create new account.

_`/signin` (login)_  
Page where user can enter email and password to enter the platform. **Default page** for
non-authorized users.

#### Member

That pages allowed only for authorized users. Should be protected by _Guards_.

_`/` (main page)_  
Page with group list and people list.**Default page** for authorized users.

_`/profile` (user profile)_  
User's information with the ability to edit it.

_`/group/{:groupID}` (broadcast page)_  
where, `:groupID` is unique group identifier;  
Page where user can send message to all participants.

_`/conversation/{:conversationID}` (person dialog)_  
where, `:conversationID` is unique room identifier with interlocutor;
Page where user can write personal messages directly.

## Declarations

### Toast

It is a discrete and ephemeral notification presented to users on a graphical user interface.
conveys concise information, notifications, or feedback in a visually unobtrusive manner. These
messages are designed to appear momentarily and autonomously vanish without necessitating user
intervention, thereby minimizing disruption to the user's ongoing tasks.

The nomenclature "toast" in this context draws an analogy from the culinary practice where a toaster
pops up, signifying the completion of the toasting process. Analogously, a toast message emerges on
the user interface, delivering pertinent information and subsequently dissipating after a brief
period.

In various graphic packages, this element is denoted by distinct
names: [Snackbar](https://material.angular.io/components/snack-bar/overview) in Angular
Material, [Toast](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/toast/overview) in NG
Bootstrap, [Toast](https://primeng.org/toast) in
PrimeNG, [Push](https://taiga-ui.dev/components/push) in Taiga UI, or you
can [make the component](https://medium.com/geekculture/simple-toast-notification-in-angular-f018b9aa3dc8)
yourself.
