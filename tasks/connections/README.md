# Connections project with real backend

Welcome to the last level of the education journey. We hope this training lesson will enhance and
strengthen your knowledge and skills to design application structure and use entire framework power
solving the issues.

This project is intended for individual performance using the real one-for-all server. You can check
out your colleagues with their progress and be faster and more productive, because everyone should
have the same functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> Application aims to improve your technical skills. You are not limited in appearance, the main
> thing is for all features to be implemented and maximum user-friendly! It means, you have to
> **come up with yours design** of the app!

## General point

Single server provides sharing data and all students can interact with it reading and writing other
data. Each student's frontend project must be **identical in functionality** and any student opening
another student's project should have the same capabilities.

## Limitations

- all users are located in different timezones. Server keeps date and time
  in [UNIX timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) format (as number), but you have care about
  appropriate timezone for everyone.
- server does not contain sufficient protection, for learning purpose we cut cumbersome redundant
  processes in order to focus on crucial features. Do not try to break it but inform us if you find
  critical defects.
- all transmitted data is **public** including personal email and messages. Do not use any sensitive
  data.
- server may have restrictions or limitations in data response if DB contains a lot of records. We
  are sincerely asking you to use it only to make sure the application works but do not overuse it
  for fun.

# Angular Application

The initial application can be generated by `@angular/cli`, it provides the latest version of
framework. Also, we recommend to use standalone approach.

You can use additional package with visual components (to simplify and speed up the development):

- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [NGX Bootstrap](https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/documentation)
- [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
- [PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/installation)

You also need [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store). Using other packages is prohibited!

## Milestones

Application is divided into separate sections:

1. [Registration](./milestone%201.registration.md); 130
2. [Login](./milestone%202.login.md)
3. [Profile](./milestone%203.profile.md)
4. [Update profile](./milestone%204.profile%20update.md)
5. [Logout](./milestone%205.logout.md)
6. [People and group sections](./milestone%206.people-groups.md)
7. [Group dialog](./milestone%207.group%20dialog.md)
8. [People conversation](./milestone%208.conversation.md)
9. [404 page](./milestone%209.404%20page.md)
10. Bonus: [Style theme](./milestone%2010.theme.md)

# Examination

Each milestone has relative score. Each milestone has number of points for successful result.

But in case if any common violation is present the project is losing **additional** points:

- any uncaught errors: **-30 points** for each unique error;
- used `any` instead of dedicated interface/type: **-30 points** for each certain case;
- 

### Url navigation
