# Technical screening

### Purposes:

1. To form the list of the students at **RSSchool stage#2**.
2. To form the "Mentor-students" subgroups. Each mentor interviews more people than he/she plans to train (e.g +2). When all interviews are done mentor expells some students (e.g -2). Mentor can postpone exclusion for a couple of weeks if he/she needs to take more considered decision.
3. To test students' qualification.
4. To get experience of passing interviews.

### Roles

- [Student](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/students.md)
- [Mentor](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/mentors.md)

### The number of students and invitation procedure

158 people have signed up as mentors for the recent RSSchool enrollment and we can invite TOP810+ students to interviews. 510+ students will continue their studies at the second stage.
The students receive invitations in the following order:

1.  On the mentor's recommendation. Mentor can train some students he/she is personally interested in.
2.  On the basis of codejam tasks and html/css/git test results.
3.  On the basis of padawans tasks.

### The process

- "student-mentor" list will be shared in Discord's channel - `#announcements`
- students should contact mentors on their own and agree on a date of an interview;
- document with your mentor's contacts will be shared in Discord's channel - `#announcements`;

### Your actions if you are not satisfied with an interview

For example, mentor wanted you to tell about closures in JS or asked you about Redux, etc during interview.
In this case you should describe the situation, claim and your vision in the feedback form - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeN-OYDhazcs7WhZi_oae-u8bCLuVcsksCeZkYcfRMMwj3eJA/viewform
