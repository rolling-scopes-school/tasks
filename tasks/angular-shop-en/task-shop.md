## Application structure

1. [Header](#header):  
  1.1 Navigation  
  1.2 Navigation to products category  
  1.3 Profile block  
1. [Footer](#footer)
1. [Shop landing page](#shop-landing-page)
1. [Category listing page](#category-listing-page)
1. [Product details page](#product-details-page)
1. [Cart](#cart)
1. [Favorite products](#favorite-products)
1. [Orders](#orders)

## **Functional requirements**

### **Header**

Header should contain:

- #### Block with information:  
  - contacts block: main contacts information and the dropdown with additional contacts

    ![Contacts](./assets/contacts.png)

  - block that contains contact center working hours

- #### Navigation block:
  - located under the **Block with information**
  - has a logo (could be any). By clicking it a user navigates to the **Shop landing page**.
  - contains the **Catalog** button, after clicking on it a panel with product categories appears (or navigation to a separate page occurs)   
  - product categories should have hierarchy 

    ![Hierarchy](./assets/categories.png)
  - the panel is divided into 2 parts - on the left are the main categories of products (the topmost level), on the right are nested categories. When you hover over any main category on the left, a list of nested categories that belong to the main category is displayed on the right.

  - search by categories and products. The results should be displayed in a dropdown box. Search results should display a list of products that match the request with the ability to go to a page with details of any of the specified products. When entering characters in the search input, implement debounce, which sends a request after an input delay (for example: 100 ms), as well as for a particular number of characters (for example: more than 2)

    ![Search](./assets/search.png)
  
  It is not necessary to create a separate page to implement search. It is enough to display the results in the dropdown.

  - #### **Account block**
    - anonymous user   
    ![Account](./assets/sign-in.png)
      - sign in, sign up buttons.

    - authorized user   
    ![Account](./assets/account.png)
      - log out button.

      - link to user **Favorite products**
      - link to user **Orders**

  - ### **Navigation to products category**

- it should be possible to sort products by price (cheap first or expensive first) and by rating   
  ![Sorting](./assets/sort.png)
- products should not be displayed all at once, but in groups of 10, after which there should be a "Show more" button, by clicking on which another group of 10 products is loaded.

### **Product details page**

- should contain the hierarchy of the selected category (breadcrumbs)
- name of product
- product images as a slider
- add to favorites button

The user can place an order only if all fields are valid, otherwise it is necessary to show an error message under the field that is filled in incorrectly.

### **Orders**

Should contain information about each user's order in the form of a list (design the way you want). Each item in the list is a separate order
  - should contain information about delivery, cost for payment, order number, elements of order cancellation / editing. Each order should be implemented as a drop-down list with a set of products in the order (product name / quantity / cost)

## Backend

As a backend, you should use the created [JSON server](https://github.com/pavelrazuvalau/rs-shop-json-server).
To do this, you need to clone the repository and run json-server locally.

## Repository requirements

- the work should be done in your private repository
- source code should be committed to a separate branch
- the **master** branch should be empty (contain only files like README.md or .gitignore)
- commit messages should follow the [guideline](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en)
- once the work is finished, create a pull request from a development branch to master
- the pull request name should contain **the task name**
- the pull request description should contain the following information:
    - link to the task
    - screenshot of your application (one would be enough)
    - link to your application
    - date of completion/deadline
    - your self-check with a preliminary evaluation that is based on the evaluation criteria from the task
