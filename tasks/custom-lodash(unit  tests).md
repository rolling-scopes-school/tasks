## Custom Lodash

Your task is to implement 'custom' version of the lodash library following next requirements:
1. Usage of `Array.prototype.*` or `Object.prototype.*` **methods** and **static methods** is **strictly forbidden**. You can use the properties, like `length`
2. You can create your own additional service functions (if needed).
3. You should use ES6+ features (any feature which supported by latest stable Chrome).
4. Lodash chain is out of scope

And **cover your code by unit tests** following next requirements:
1. You should use Jest for the current task
2. You shoud follow TDD (Test-driven development)
3. The code coverage should be at least 80% (branches and functions)
4. You can use any of the built in array and object methods for the actual unit tests

## Methods to implement:
### Arrays:
* [chunk](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#chunk)
* [compact](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#compact) 
* [drop](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#drop) 
* [dropWhile](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#dropWhile) 
* [take](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#take) 
* [filter](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#filter) 
* [find](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#find) 
* [includes](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#includes) 
* [map](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#map) 
* [zip](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#zip) 

### Objects:
* [merge](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#merge) 
* [omit](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#omit) 
* [omitBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#omitBy) 
* [pick](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#pick) 
* [pickBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11#pickBy) 

### The score is on proportion to the coverage
