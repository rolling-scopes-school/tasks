## Custom Lodash

Your task is to implement 'custom' version of the lodash library following next requirements:
1. Usage of `Array.prototype.*` or `Object.prototype.*` **methods** and **static methods** is **strictly forbidden**. You can use the properties, like `length`
2. You can create your own additional service functions (if needed).
3. You should use ES6+ features (any feature which supported by latest stable Chrome).
4. Lodash chain is out of scope

And **cover your code by unit tests** following next requirements:
1. You should use Jest for the current task
2. You shoud follow TDD (Test-driven development)
3. The code coverage should be at least 80% (branches and functions)
4. You can use any of the built in array and object methods for the actual unit tests
