# Game (JavaScript + HTML or Canvas/WebGl/SVG).
## Functional requirements
You need to create simplified clone of the game https://www.prodigygame.com/
Gameplay example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXUIRnQ4EJ4
Target audience: children 6-8 y.o.

### Minimal functionality
  1) Battle screen
  2) Modal dialog with possibility to choose a spell
  3) Task screen
  4) Screen with the high score list

### Gameplay example step by step:
1. The Battle begins, Player and Monster have 100hp or more each.
2. Modal dialog appears and the Player chooses a spell first. It's up to you how to name and animate the spell. Spell types can also be different - with damage or heal effect or both.
3. The Player goes to the Task screen. If the Player solves the task correctly, the spell will be applied, if the answer is wrong, it's Monster's turn to attack.
4. The Monster rolls attack and damages the Player.
5. If the Player wins, there will be a new battle with the next Monster. If the Player loses, high score table appears on the screen and it shows number of defeated Monsters and Player name. 

### Options of the Task screen:
 1) Solving the basic arithmetic expressions. Random pair of numbers and random math operation are generated. For example *25 + 67* or *130 - 7* or *7 x 11* etc.
 2) Translation from English into Russian. The Player sees a random English word (for example: *cat*) and should enter the translation. There can be more than one correct translation variant (*кот, кошка, котик* etc.). Vocabulary should be uploaded in a separate file and it should be easy to configure. There is no need to create admin panel for the dictionary.
 3) The letters of the word are mixed and you should make the correct word from them using **drag & drop**. For example *lleyow -> yellow*. Here is an example of the interface: https://jqueryui.com/sortable/.
 4) Listening. https://mdn.github.io/web-speech-api/speak-easy-synthesis/ You listen to the audio for a word and type what you hear.
 5) Ballon Burst. Here you can find a gameplay example https://learnenglishkids.britishcouncil.org/en/tricky-words/strong-angry-king (expand "Game" accordion)
 6) Any other tasks.

### Monsters:
1) Autogenerated name. The name is the composition of the elements from three arrays.  
   First array consists of adjectives - "*terrible*", "*vicious*", "*snotty*" etc.  
   Second array contains for example "*Ogre*", "*Dwarf*", "*Goblin*" etc.
   Third array with names - "*Tom*", "*Max*", "*Dima*" etc.  
   As a result you get **"Terrible Ogre Tom"**.
2) Autogenerated body that consists from the parts: you define several "heads", "bodies", "legs", "weapons" from which the final Monster will be created. For example - https://drive.google.com/open?id=12TYpEwRPKjwkC3Q61aAqmxL8wsbVw6pP

- https://anton-yatskevich.github.io/stickman-warriors-game/dist/
- http://rini.surge.sh/
- https://olegkoleda.github.io/epicgame/

## Technical requirements:
1) Browser support: latest version of Google **Chrome**
2) Usage of **JS/ES2015+** or **TypeScript**
3) It is forbidden to use any game engines/frameworks (for example https://phaser.io/).  
   You can use libraries and frameworks like react/angular/vue/jquery/bootstrap.
4) Final version of the game should be **available by link**. The easiest way to realize it is to publish your project on Github pages (e.g. https://themarkmarrone.github.io/petrovich/, https://spider-shooter.github.io)
5) **Landing page**. This page should include the next information:
   - Name of the Game
   - Gameplay screenshots
   - Link to start the game
   - Information about the author
   - If there were two people who created the game - put the precise information about tasks each of them did. 
 
### Requirements to the commits, PR, repository
https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/docs/blob/master/stage2-tasks-requirements.md

### Requirements to the quality of code
- Don't use nested SetTimeout, synchronization of code using timeouts etc. Use promises/async/await where it's possible.
- Don't use magic number instead of named constants.  
  For example, instead of  
  `if (event.keyCode === 32 || event.keyCode === 13) {….}`  
  use  
  `if (event.keyCode === KeyboardEvent.SPACE || key === KeyboardEvent.ENTER ) {….}` etc.
- Don't use functions, that have more than 40 lines of code (excluding variable declarations).
- Minimal use of ternary operators.
- Use pure functions where it's possible. If you haven't heard this term before, you can start acquaintance [here](https://medium.com/@jamesjefferyuk/javascript-what-are-pure-functions-4d4d5392d49c) or [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976) 
- Use meaningful names for variables. Avoid single characters for variable names (i,n,j,d etc.), abstract or common names (obj, arr, num, item1 etc.)

### Project structure. Organization of files and folders(example):
Using of webpack is a must! Components directories should include all needed resources and styles. For example, by removing folder `modal-dialog` all styles related to this dialog will be removed as well.

Notes for webpack usage: 
- There is no sense to put your code inside of Immediately-invoked Function Expression.
- There is no sense to apply 'use strict' mode.

# Delivery process and score criteria
### Delivery process:
 - The final scoring and reviewing will be performed **NOT** by your mentor from stage#2. The list "*student - reviewer*" will be published after the deadline.
 - You'll have up to **30 min** to present your project.
