## Angular. Components. Directives & Pipes task

### Task requirements
The main goal of this task is to implement the main page of the YouTube client app.
You are to enrich previously generated components with necessary functionality and markup.

You can use any UI frameworks/libraries to simplify (facilitate) the creation of your markup. It's recommended to use Angular Material as it’s fully integrated with Angular.

#### Components structure
- Header
    - Logo
    - Search input with submit button
    - Settings button
    - Login information block
- Filtering criteria block
    - Buttons that represent each sort criterion
    - Input that is related to the "by word or sentence" criterion which is used for filtering results
- Search results block
    - Search result item
        - Video thumbnail
        - Views count
        - Likes count
        - Dislikes count
        - Comments count
        - Video title
        - "More button"

#### Functional requirements
- Once a user is entered the app, The only **Header** component should be shown.
For now, you can enter whatever value which won't influence your search result.
Please note that the **Sorting criteria block** should be hidden
- By submitting the search form, the **Search results block** appears.
- Using the [response example](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/response.json), render cards with predefined data
    You can store the mocked data in the **Search results** component
    - The bottom border represents the publication date status. Create a directive to change background color of the border
        - If older than 6 months – Red
        - If from a month up to 6 months – Yellow
        - If from seven days up to a month – Green
        - If younger than 7 days – Blue
- By clicking on the **Settings button**, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled
    - It should be possible to sort search results by date or count of views
    - Sorting should work both in the direction of decreasing values and in the direction of increasing values
    - Using a pipe, filter search results by value that a user types in the input
