## Angular. Components. Directives & Pipes task

### Task requirements

The main goal of this task is to implement the main page of the YouTube client app.
You are to enrich previously generated components with necessary functionality and markup.

You can use any UI frameworks/libraries to simplify (facilitate) the creation of your markup. It's recommended to use Angular Material as it‚Äôs fully integrated with Angular.

**[YouTube client. Main page](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/main.jpg)**
NB: Visual design and colour scheme of the app is by your taste and up to you - just all the necessary components should be created and usually better if they would be on their recommended places, though you can also follow one to one the offered design.

#### Components structure

- Header
  - Logo
  - Search input with submit button
  - Settings button
  - Login information block
- Filtering criteria block
  - Buttons that represent each sort criterion
  - Input that is related to the "by word or sentence" criterion which is used for filtering results
- Search results block
  - Search result item
    - Video thumbnail
    - Views count
    - Likes count
    - Dislikes count
    - Comments count
    - Video title
    - "More button"

#### Functional requirements

- When user opens the app, only the **Header** section should be shown
- After submitting the search form, the **Search results block** appears.
- Show cards of videos populated with mocked data (use data from [response example](./response.json) file). You can store the mocked data in the **Search results** component
  - The bottom border represents the publication date status. The following border colors should be used:
    - üü• if older than 6 months
    - üü® if between 1 and 6 months
    - üü© if between 7 days and 1 month
    - üü¶ if newer than 7 days
- By clicking the **Settings** button, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled on/off
  - It should be possible to sort search results by date or view count
  - Sorting should work in both ascending and descending directions of the values
  - Filter search results by the value that user types in the input

NB: Though new Angular 18 generates Standalone components by default, and standalone architecture is recommended by Angular developers for all the new projects - in one of the future tasks you'll be asked to implement some of the components as modules to get acquainted with NgModules concept, since they are still widely used in legacy code and a lot of projects were created on Angular 14 and lower versions, and in sake of learning different approaches.

#### Evaluation criteria

Maximum score - **100**

- [ ] Main layout is implemented (**+10**)
