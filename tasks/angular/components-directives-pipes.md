## Angular. Components. Directives & Pipes task

### Task requirements

The main goal of this task is to implement the main page of the YouTube client app.
You are to enrich previously generated components with necessary functionality and markup.

You can use any UI frameworks/libraries to simplify (facilitate) the creation of your markup. It's recommended to use Angular Material as itâ€™s fully integrated with Angular.

#### Components structure

- Header
  - Logo
  - Search input with submit button
  - Settings button
  - Login information block
- Filtering criteria block
  - Buttons that represent each sort criterion
  - Input that is related to the "by word or sentence" criterion which is used for filtering results
- Search results block
  - Search result item
    - Video thumbnail
    - Views count
    - Likes count
    - Dislikes count
    - Comments count
    - Video title
    - "More button"

#### Functional requirements

- When user opens the app, only the **Header** section should be shown
- After submitting the search form, the **Search results block** appears.
- Show cards of videos populated with mocked data (use data from [response example](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/response.json) file). You can store the mocked data in the **Search results** component
  - The bottom border represents the publication date status. The following border colors should be used:
    - ðŸŸ¥ if older than 6 months
    - ðŸŸ¨ if between 1 and 6 months
    - ðŸŸ© if between 7 days and 1 month
    - ðŸŸ¦ if newer than 7 days
- By clicking the **Settings** button, the **Filtering criteria block** should be toggled on/off
  - It should be possible to sort search results by date or view count
  - Sorting should work in both ascending and descending directions of the values
  - Filter search results by the value that user types in the input

#### Evaluation criteria

Maximum score - **100**

- [ ] Main layout is implemented (**+10**)
- [ ] Fake search functionality is implemented: by submitting the form in the **Header** component, search results are shown (**+20**)
- [ ] The **Search result item** component contains all the necessary data (**+10**)
- [ ] The **Filtering criteria block** toggle functionality is implemented (**+5**)
- [ ] The colored border under the **Search result item** is implemented using a `Directive` (**+15**)
- [ ] Search result sorting is implemented (both ascending and descending directions) (**+15**)
- [ ] Search result filtering by key words is implemented using a `Pipe` (**+15**)
- [ ] Custom Button component is implemented and used across the application. The component utilizes [Content projection](https://angular.io/guide/content-projection) to display the button text (**+5**)
- [ ] One of the components is implemented as [standalone](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components). Strong recommendation to choose a simple presentational component and not a "Smart" container component for this task (**+5**)
