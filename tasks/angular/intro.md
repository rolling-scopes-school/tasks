# YouTube client app

During the Angular course, you are to implement the YouTube client app. You can refer to the [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/tS3Zqk138yXUmRxSWKDv4r/YouTube-client?node-id=0%3A1)

## Angular. Intro task

### Getting started

- Install _@angular/cli_ package. It's highly recommended to use _SCSS_ as the default stylesheet
- Use the Angular CLI to create a new project with Angular v18 or later
- Don't recommend to use ESLint v9 or later (we suggest using ESLint v8)
- Explore the generated project structure

### Task requirements

Within this task, you are to start implementing the main page of the app.

#### Project structure

The project structure can be organized in the following way:

```
    app
    ├── header
    │   ├── header
    ├── search
    │   ├── search-results
    │   ├── search-item
    |   |── search-response.model.ts
    │   ├── search-item.model.ts
    │   ...
    ├── app.component.html
    ├── app.component.scss
    ├── app.component.ts
    ├── app.component.spec.ts
    ├── app.module.ts
    ...
```

#### Task scope

- Generate a new Angular project using ng-cli
- Migrate Angular application to ESLint with rules [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Think about how to break down the whole app into smaller pieces.
- Generate all the necessary components using ng-cli. The search result list and each item should be represented as separate components
- Based on the mocked response which is stored in .json file, create necessary interfaces

Please bear in mind that you don’t need to implement any logic or markup. The outcome of this task should contain only newly generated and empty components.
