# YouTube client app

[Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/tS3Zqk138yXUmRxSWKDv4r/YouTube-client?node-id=0%3A1)

## Angular. RxJS & Observables. HTTP task

In the scope of the task, you are to implement some features using RxJS. In addition, the goal is to start using real
YouTube API for requesting data in the app.

### Task requirements

#### Samples of YouTube REST API requests:

    https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key=AIzaSyCTWC75i70moJLzyNh3tt4jzCljZcRkU8Y&type=video&part=snippet&maxResults=15&q=js
    https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?key=AIzaSyCTWC75i70moJLzyNh3tt4jzCljZcRkU8Y&id=nq4aU9gmZQk,REu2BcnlD34,qbPTdW7KgOg&part=snippet,statistics

- You can find a more detailed documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

#### Functional requirements

- **Global search functionality**
  - remove the _Search_ button. Now we're going to invoke the search logic once the user types something
  - in order not to spam our API, create a new Observable in your component and emit changes until the user enters at
    least 3 characters
  - add debounce functionality to prevent API calls from being performed if the user is still typing.
- **Login block**
  - create a new Observable in the **Login service** that will emit a boolean which indicates whether the user is
    logged in or not.
  - show the "Login" and "Logout" button if the user is logged out / logged in
- **HTTP requests and YouTube API**
  - remove the mocked response from your project and use a service that is created in the **YouTube module**.
  - use the HTTP interceptor to shorten request URLs in your services and pass your access token.
