## Angular: Modules, Services, Routing Task

The goal of this task is to implement new pages using modules, services, and routing features. After finishing, your app should include the following pages

- Login page. [Mockup (JPG)](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/login.jpg)
- 404 page. [Mockup (JPG)](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/404.jpg)
- Main page (which is implemented before). [Mockup (JPG)](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/main.jpg)
- Detailed information page. [Mockup (JPG)](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/angular/details-page.jpg)

### Task requirements

To continue with the YouTube app, some structural refactoring is required.
First, your project should be reorganized into the following modules:

- **CoreModule:** This module is designated for global layout components such as Header and Footer, along with global services. It needs to be integrated within the **AppModule**
- **YoutubeModule:** This is a feature module for YouTube functionalities. It should contain the main page (previously implemented), the **Detailed Information Page**, and related models, services, etc.
- **AuthModule:** This module will contain the login page, login service, and corresponding components.
- **SharedModule (optional):** If implemented, this module should consist of shared components, directives, and pipes. It can be imported into each feature module as needed.

#### Important notes

- The **CoreModule** should be imported only **ONCE** into the AppModule to avoid any re-imports.
- **app.component** should **NOT** contain any logic at this stage of development.
- The **SharedModule**, if implemented, should **NOT** include services.

#### Project structure and technical requirements

The project structure can be organized in the following way:

```
    app
    ├── core
    │   ├── components
    │   ├── pages
    │   ├── services
    │   ├── guards
    ├── shared
    │   ├── components
    │   ├── directives
    │   ├── models
    │   ├── pipes
    ├── youtube
    │   ├── components
    │   ├── directives
    │   ├── models
    │   ├── pages
    │   ├── pipes
    │   ├── services
    ├── auth
    │   ├── components
    │   ├── models
    │   ├── pages
    │   ├── services
    ├── app.component.html
    ├── app.component.scss
    ├── app.component.ts
    ├── app.component.spec.ts
    ├── app.module.ts
```

All the feature modules (**YouTubeModule**, **AuthModule**) must be lazy-loaded which means that they are going to be imported by using routing features rather than the direct import into a module.

Pages directory contains components that represent individual pages (**Login page**, **Main page**, **Detailed information page**, etc) and used in the router configuration.

#### Functional requirements

- **404 page**
  - If the user entered an incorrect URL which is missing in the router configuration, the app should redirect him to the 404 page
- **Login page**
  - When the user isn't logged in, the app should prevent him/her from navigating to any pages other than the login page. A router guard would be helpful to implement such behavior.
  - There’s no user validation at this stage. You can enter arbitrary credentials and invoke login using an appropriate service.
  - Create a login service to enable the required login functionality.
  - Once the user has submitted the form, an appropriate method should be called in the login service that saves a fake auth token in _localStorage_. Then, the user should be redirected to the **Main page**. If the user gets logged out, he/she should be redirected to the initial login page and the auth token should be deleted from _localStorage_.
  - The login button in the Header component could remain inactive for now, because implementing its functionality requires some RxJS-based features (we’ll deal with it in the upcoming lesson and corresponding task). In order to implement the logout functionality, you can create a separate button that calls the logout method of the login service.
- **Main page**
  - Move the state and its methods from the Board component to a dedicated service.
  - By clicking the _More_ button, the **Detailed information** page should appear
- **Detailed information page**
  - Should contain information about the selected video.
  - To determine which video is selected, pass its id as a route param

#### Optional task (without points)

- Develop two logger services to handle logging differently for development and production modes. Use the logger service to log the message in the console after the user is logged in
  - DevLoggerService: This service should log messages with a [DEV] prefix. Example: _[DEV]: App is running in the development mode_
  - ProdLoggerService: This service should log messages with a [PROD] prefix. Example: _[PROD]: App is running in the production mode_
- You could place this services in the **CoreModule**
- For better implementetion you could create an abstract class LoggerService with a method logMessage that takes in a message and logs it. Both DevLoggerService and ProdLoggerService should extend this abstract class, providing their own prefix values.
- Provide one of the logger services for the entire app based on the mode it's running in.

_Note: You could use the isDevMode() function from Angular to check this. To check the implementation in the prod mode you can use **ng serve --configuration production** command_
