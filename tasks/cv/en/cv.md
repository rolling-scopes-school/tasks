# CV

## Project Description

CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a document in which a job applicant describes their education and work experience. Unlike a resume, which is tailored to the requirements of each specific job vacancy, a CV displays professional achievements and skills over the entire period of education and work.

## Task

You need to create your CV using Markdown markup language and then style it using HTML and CSS.

## Key Skills:

- Working with Git and GitHub
- Using Markdown markup language
- Basic web development skills
- Using [rs app](https://app.rs.school/) for task submission and evaluation

## Project Workflow Stages:

The project consists of three parts:

#### CV#1. Markdown & Git

- [Requirements and Evaluation Criteria](git-markdown.md)
- [Tips for Completing the Assignment Using VS Code](cv-hints.md)
- [Tips for Completing the Assignment Using GitHub](cv-github-hints.md)
- In this part of the task, you create a personal public repository named `rsschool-cv`, add your CV in Markdown format to it, and deploy it on GitHub Pages.
- Evaluation is based on the commit history and pull request.
- Estimated completion time: 2 hours
- Evaluation method: Automated testing

#### CV#2. HTML, CSS & Git Basics

- [Requirements and Evaluation Criteria](html-css-git.md)
- [Tips for Completing the Assignment Using VS Code](cv-hints.md)
- [Tips for Completing the Assignment Using GitHub](cv-github-hints.md)
- In this part of the task, you continue working in the previously created repository. Create another branch called `rsschool-cv-html`, add `index.html` and `style.css` files with arbitrary content to it, and deploy them on GitHub Pages.
- Evaluation is based on the commit history and pull request.
- Estimated completion time: 1 hour
- Evaluation method: Automated testing

#### CV#3. CV. Cross-Check

- [Requirements and Evaluation Criteria [RU]](../cv-stage0.md)
- [Tips for Completing the Assignment [RU]](../cv-stage0-hints.md)
- In this part of the task, you design and style your CV.
- Evaluation is based on the validity and semantics of the design and the content of the CV.

- Evaluation method: Cross-check

You have 2 weeks to complete the project.
