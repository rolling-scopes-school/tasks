   - Provide a description for the Pull Request following this [schema](https://docs.rs.school/#/en/pull-request-review-process?id=Требования-к-pull-request-pr).
   - Do not merge the Pull Request from the `rsschool-cv-html` branch into the `main` branch.
5. Create a Pull Request from the `rsschool-cv-html` branch to the `gh-pages` branch.
   - Choose a title for the Pull Request at your discretion.
   - No need to provide a description for this Pull Request.
   - Merge the Pull Request from the `rsschool-cv-html` branch into the `gh-pages` branch.
