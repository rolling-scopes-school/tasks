# Self-Introduction

The task is to record a short (**3–5 minutes**) video with a self-presentation.

> ## What to talk about
>
> - Who you are. Name, main skill, and role. For example, "My name is ... and I'm a junior full-stack developer".
> - Briefly about your education. For example, "I am a recent computer science graduate from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics and am currently attending the RSSchool frontend course".
> - What you are interested in learning, your professional plans, and your motivation for programming - this will also help mentors choose the most motivated students who are on the waitlist.
> - About your study or pet project that you've been working on lately. Describe its purpose, main technologies, challenges faced, and outcomes.

At the same time, there are no restrictions — you decide what information about yourself to share.

## Procedure

1. Record a video of your presentation in English. It is preferable that your face is visible in the frame (you can use a webcam, phone camera, video camera, laptop camera, etc.).
2. Upload the video to your personal [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) account. You can make the video available only by link — for this, set the video settings to [Access Settings > Link Access (Visibility > Unlisted)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).
