## Task "Async Race"

#### Try to imagine the scenario.

Your customer has an idea to spend their money. They have hired some engineers who installed radio-controlled equipment :radio: in real cars :car:. To be precise, in their entire collection of cars. They are eager to create a kind of drag-racing competition to discover which car is the fastest.
Each radio controller has an HTTP-compatible interface. It lets you start or stop the engine of the car and, of course, enable "driving" mode.
Your task is to create a [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) to manage the collection of cars, operate their engines, and show race statistics.

Previously, the development of this application was started (and almost finished) by a freelance developer named Mikhama. However, his laptop :computer: was stolen by bad guys. Unfortunately, we don't have any sources for the UI :disappointed:. Fortunately, he had recorded some [demo](https://youtu.be/aLjibbo9spo). In addition, he had stored the server mock in his [repo](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).
We found in the latest news that a new company called "The Fast and the Furious" announced the release of a new product that will really blow people's minds. There isn't a lot of information about this product. All we know is that it's about "easier car management than you can imagine." It's exactly what our thieves :supervillain: are up to. They're going to release their product in two weeks. But we can't allow them to do that. We must be first.

What are you waiting for? Let's start coding!

## üéØ Objectives

- **Create a Single Page Application (SPA)**: Manage a collection of cars, operate their engines, and showcase race statistics in an engaging, interactive SPA.
- **Revive the Project**: Drawing inspiration from a demo video and a server mock, reconstruct the UI and breathe life back into this ambitious project.
- **Outpace the Competition**: Implement the project with speed and efficiency, ensuring we launch before our rivals, showcasing our innovative solution to car management and racing competitions.

## üöó Functional Requirements

### Basic Structure

- Two main views: "Garage" and "Winners."
- Persistent state of the user interface between switches, maintaining user input and pagination.
- The race condition when switching between views can be handled according to your preference (the race can be reset, continue, or stop). The main thing is to handle it correctly.

### Garage View

- Name of view ("Garage")
- Car creation and editing panel.
  - Field for entering the name (creating a car).
  - Color picker (creating a car).
  - Field for entering the name (editing a car).
  - Color picker (editing a car).
  - (Or you can use only one field and picker for both).
- Race control panel.
  - Race start and reset buttons.
  - Button for creating 100 random cars.
- Garage section.
  - Cars sections.
    - Car control panel.
      - Button to start and stop a single race.
      - Buttons for selecting and deleting a car.
    - Car's name.
    - Race track.
  - The number of all cars in the garage.
  - Pagination to display cars (7 per page).

### Winners View

- Name of view ("Winners")
- Winners table, with the following columns:
  - Car number.
  - Car icon.
  - Name.
  - Number of wins.
  - Best time.
- Pagination to display cars (10 per page).

### Race

- Adaptive animations that work on screens as small as 500px.
- Winner banner. Shown at the end of the race, in case there is a winner.
- During a running race, navigation through the application and manipulations with cars should be handled. You can manage this at your discretion, but the work must be correct.
  _Example: The race is started and we are trying to remove a car. Possible solutions:_
  - _Block the remove button until the end of the race._
  - _Stop the race and remove the car._

## üìú Non-functional Requirements

- **Framework Usage**: Development must utilize either React v18+ or Angular v17+.
- **State Manager**: When using React v18+ it is mandatory to use a state manager (Redux, Redux toolkit, MobX or other). React.Context can also be used, but is not recommended.
- **TypeScript Mandatory**: Strong typing enforced throughout. TypeScript `strict` mode must be enabled, and the `noImplicitAny` flag set to `true` to ensure no implicit `any` types are used.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between API interaction, UI rendering, and state management.
- **SPA Implementation**: All content must be generated using TypeScript with strict type checking.
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to ESLint configuration based on recommended rules for TypeScript and React (`eslint:recommended`, `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`, `plugin:react/recommended`, `plugin:react-hooks/recommended`). Avoid magic numbers and magic strings. The `tsconfig.json` must be configured to enforce strict typing principles (`strict: true`, `noImplicitAny: true`).
- **UI Design**: The design is completely up to you. In this project, we care about the quality of the code and the fulfillment of other functional and non-functional requirements.

- These criteria emphasize the importance of clean code, proper architecture, and adherence to modern development practices. Intreviewers will use these guidelines to assess the technical execution and overall quality of the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- Implement [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for cars using the provided server mock.
- Design UI elements for car management and race controls.
- Utilize fetch for server communication, and handle promises for asynchronous tasks.
- Create animations for car movements using TypeScript and CSS.

## Requirements to commits and repo

### Commit Guidelines

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) format.
- Use lowercase for commit types (`init`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, etc.).
- Write in present tense (e.g., "add feature") and imperative mood (e.g., "move cursor to...").

#### Commit Examples

- `init:` Start a project/task (e.g., `init: start youtube-task`).
- `feat:` Introduce new features (e.g., `feat: add zoom support`).
- `fix:` Correct bugs in existing features (e.g., `fix: correct data loading`).
- `refactor:` Improve the code without altering functionality (e.g., `refactor: rename vars`).
- `docs:` Update documentation (e.g., `docs: update readme`).

### README.md

When your solution is implemented, please include the checklist below in the `README.md`. Check all implemented features, then calculate your score and put it at the top of the `README.md`.

Also, please deploy the UI to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or a similar service, and put the link at the top of the `README.md` (alone with the calculated score).

## üîÑ Evaluation Rules

- **[@Candidate]** The UI should be deployed to gh-pages, Netlify, or a similar service, and the link should be included in the `README.md`.
- **[@Reviewer]** You should clone the [server repository](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.git) and keep the server running during the functionality review.
- **[@Reviewer]** Test task should be evaluated based on both functional and non-functional requirements.
- **[@Candidate]** Pay close attention to details in the implementation, as bugs and deviations from the requirements can impact your score.
- **[@Reviewer]** If bugs are found, the following deductions can be applied:
  - (**-30**) Major bug (implemented functionality works but breaks down after certain manipulations, with unexpected errors in the browser's console).
  - (**-10**) Minor bug (implemented functionality works but behaves inconsistently after certain manipulations, such as a button not becoming enabled after changing some state, with no errors in the browser's console).
  - **Note:** If you repeatedly press the "start engine button" then the "stop engine button" or the "start race button" then the "reset race button" and see a "404" or "429" error, this is not considered a bug.

## FAQ

#### Question: How do I integrate the mock server with my GitHub repository?

First, you'll need to clone the mock server's repository to your local machine and make sure it's up and running. Next, your task is to develop the user interface (UI) in a separate repository of your own. This setup requires the server to be active in your local environment (localhost), eliminating the need for backend deployment. It's important to understand that changes to the backend are not allowed, as the evaluation process involves using an unmodified version of the backend, specifically the one originally provided.

#### Question: Is it possible to use any UI component libraries like Ant Design?

Feel free to use any library

#### Question about sorting the winners. The page displays 10 entries. Should the sorting be applied to just these 10 entries, or to the entire array of winners?

The entire array - that's the whole idea, to use query string parameters to request a portion of the data (including the sorted ones). The JSON-server API handles this perfectly.
